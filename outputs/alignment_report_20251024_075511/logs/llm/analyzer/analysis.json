Though there are a lot of words and the list just goes on and on, I chose the basic ones and what I think would be interesting for everyone to know!\n\nNow the big question:\n WHAT THE HELL IS AN OSHI?\n\n• Oshi (推し/おし)\n\n– the word oshi literally means\n “push”\n but it is now the common term used for people who is a fan of something or someone.\n– can also be referred to a person who likes a group or a person who likes a certain member.\n– also commonly known as \n\n### Evidence 20: Japanese for NERDS: Oshikatsu, Otakatsu, BLkatsu, and language – rentaBLog\nhttps://rentablog.org/2023/09/19/japanese-for-nerds-oshikatsu-otakatsu-blkatsu-and-language/\n\nJapanese for NERDS: Oshikatsu, Otakatsu, BLkatsu, and language – rentaBLog\n\nSkip to content\n\nAs you may have seen from my posts, I like to sprinkle in a lot of Japanese to help people learn and contextualize the language and culture a majority of our content comes from. While we’re a localization company, I know a lot of people who read manga do intend on eventually learning and hopefully mastering Japanese someday, whether it’s in order to not have to rely on English licenses to get that sweet, sweet content, or even just to be able to comfortably follow Japanese mangaka, publishers, or fan accounts, and it can be helpful to learn bit by bit through your hobbies.\n\nStill in the process of my own Japanese-learning journey (I think most language learning never actually ends, honestly—even in your native language), after living in Japan for four and a half years I’ve found there are a lot of words that’re hard to know without specifically taking part in the cultures surrounding them.

Also, girls seem to be labeling themselves/ their style with this term, but I'm not sure if they're doing it unironically or not.

Also, girls seem to be labeling themselves/ their style with this term, but I'm not sure if they're doing it unironically or not.

Sadly, thats grown popular in the vtuber scene and online spaces in japan. For vtuber fans reading this who think that’s a weird thing to say, the word “menhera” has been around since 2001 and was the name given to an internet subculture revolving around mental health safe spaces, awareness, and vent art. Even tho it was literally created to help erase the “mental illness makes you dangerous” thing, the stigma took over once the term went mainstream, so its often used to mean “yandere psycho”.

Labeling the music with a loaded word like \nmenhera, \nhowever, is simply insensitive, if not disturbing in the way it flattens depression into a supposedly recognizable aesthetic.

The rise of \nconsumerism\n, which played an important part in Japan's \"national character\" during its economic boom in the 1980s, continues to influence fashion purchases, even after this economic bubble burst in the 1990s.

Sadly, thats grown popular in the vtuber scene and online spaces in japan. For vtuber fans reading this who think that’s a weird thing to say, the word “menhera” has been around since 2001 and was the name given to an internet subculture revolving around mental health safe spaces, awareness, and vent art. Even tho it was literally created to help erase the “mental illness makes you dangerous” thing, the stigma took over once the term went mainstream, so its often used to mean “yandere psycho”. The subculture still exists if you know where to look, but barely ever uses the name it gave itself anymore because it attracts trolls, edgelords, and fetishists.\nOne last thing- a few of these girls fit the “loli” archetype, and consider it a part of their appeal, but no minors will be featured on this list.\nabsolutely zero past-\n\n### Evidence 77: Urban Dictionary: Landmine-Girl\nhttps://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Landmine-Girl\n\nost Japanese men, being regarded as mentally and emotionally draining.\nHowever, just like Menhera, it has become a sort of \nfashion trend\n amongst Japanese women and has given room for a specific style associated with 'Jirai Onna', also called 'Jirai Kei'.\nLandmine-Girls/Women are typically characterized by their red eyeshadow, eye bag makeup, thick bangs, twin tails, Sanrio accessories, ribbons and very feminine clothing with slight gothic accents from brands like Liz Lisa, Ank Rouge, and Honey Cinnamon.\n\"\nWomen\n with over 2 two \nribbons\n on their body are 20,000,000% a 'Landmine-Girl'.\" -Kiryu \nCoco\nby \nTriMeruu\n October 9, 2020\nFlag\n \nGet the \nLandmine-Girl\nmug.\n \n \nMore random definitions\n \n \n© 1999-2025 Urban Dictionary ®\n \nads\nhelp\nprivacy\nterms of service\ndmca\naccessibility statement\nreport a bug\ninformation collection notice\nsystem status\ndata subject access request\n \nShare this definition\n \nCopy Link\n \nFacebook\n \n \nX\n \n \nPinterest\n \n \nWhatsApp\n \n \nReddit\n \n \nEmail\n\n### Evidence 78: Reddit - The heart of the internet\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/g6dj45/can_someone_explain_what_a_mine_woman_%E5%9C%B0%E9%9B%B7%E5%A5%B3_is/\n\nnd goth style coords popped up.

Even tho it was literally created to help erase the “mental illness makes you dangerous” thing, the stigma took over once the term went mainstream, so its often used to mean “yandere psycho”.

The lyrical content is more emotionally frank, depressive, and aggressive compared to the average pop song. The verses ignore pop brevity and instead like to go on long-winded. The scrolling lyric video not only gets at how much the lyrics bleed over the margins but also how it resembles raw internet text, either on forums, IMs or iPhone conversa\n\n### Evidence 179: Terms | Japanese Fashion Wikia | Fandom\nhttps://j-fashion.fandom.com/wiki/Terms\n\nse magazines, this term is often used to describe a style that is sexy and appeals to men.

    "content": "**Report on the \"Jirai Kei\" culture**\n\n**Introduction:**\nJirai Kei (地雷系), which translates to \"landmine type,\" is a Japanese youth subculture that emerged online and in street fashion in the early 2020s (aesthetics.fandom.com, j-fashion.fandom.com). The name originates from the Japanese internet slang term \"Jirai Onna\" (地雷女) or \"landmine woman,\" a phrase initially used on anonymous forums to describe women perceived as psychologically unstable or emotionally volatile (ewadirect.com, j-fashion.fandom.com). The subculture encompasses a distinct fashion aesthetic, specific makeup styles, and a set of associated behavioral stereotypes that have become a controversial form of self-expression (j-fashion.fandom.com, reddit.com).\n\n**Background:**\nThe Jirai Kei subculture is primarily associated with young people, online social media platforms, and the nightlife of areas like Tokyo's Kabukichō district (aesthetics.fandom.com). It manifests as a fashion style that combines \"kawaii\" (cute) and hyperfeminine elements with darker, gothic aesthetics (moeflavor.com, reddit.com). While the term \"Jirai\" began as a derogatory label for individuals considered troublesome or mentally unstable in relationships, it has been adopted by some participants as a reclaimed identity (aesthetics.fandom.com, moeflavor.com). The subculture is often linked with themes of emotional intensity, obsessive tendencies, and the romanticization of self-destructive behaviors, creating a complex identity that is part aesthetic and part stereotyped persona (aesthetics.fandom.com, urbandictionary.com).\n\n**Unique terms and their interpretations:**\n*   x01: **Jirai (地雷)** — Literally means \"land mine\" (jisho.org). In slang, it refers to a sensitive topic or \"trigger\" that can set someone off. It is also used metaphorically to describe a person, particularly a woman, who appears fine initially but proves to be emotionally unstable or troublesome in a relationship (wiktionary.org, j-fashion.fandom.com).\n*   x02: **Jirai Kei (地雷系)** — Literally \"landmine style/type\" (j-fashion.fandom.com). It refers to the fashion and aesthetic subculture characterized by a dark, yet cute and feminine style. It implies an association with the \"Jirai\" personality stereotype (aesthetics.fandom.com).\n*   x03: **Jirai Onna (地雷女) / Jirai Joshi (地雷女子)** — Translates to \"landmine woman\" or \"landmine girl\" (urbandictionary.com, j-fashion.fandom.com). Originally a derogatory term for a woman with a perceived difficult or unstable personality. Within the subculture, it refers to a female participant or the persona they adopt (fun-japan.jp).\n*   x04: **Jirai Danshi (地雷男子)** — Translates to \"landmine boy\" (j-fashion.fandom.com). The male equivalent of a Jirai Joshi, referring to men who participate in the subculture or fit the associated stereotypes.\n*   x05: **Landmine Girl / Mine Woman** — The direct English translation of Jirai Onna/Joshi, used interchangeably in English-language discussions of the subculture (urbandictionary.com, reddit.com).\n*   x06: **Kei (系)** — A Japanese suffix meaning \"style,\" \"type,\" \"lineage,\" or \"system.\" It is commonly used in fashion to denote a specific subculture or aesthetic (j-fashion.fandom.com).\n*   x07: **Onna (女) / Joshi (女子)** — Japanese words for \"woman\" and \"girl,\" respectively. Used to specify the gender of the subculture participant (j-fashion.fandom.com, fun-japan.jp).\n*   x08: **Danshi (男子)** — Japanese word for \"boy\" or \"man\" (j-fashion.fandom.com).\n*   x09: **Menhera (メンヘラ)** — Japanese internet slang derived from \"mental health-er\" (frontiersin.org). It refers to individuals perceived as having mental health issues and is associated with behaviors like obsession and attention-seeking. It has also evolved into a related fashion aesthetic (urbandictionary.com, thissidejapan.substack.com).\n*   x10: **Yami Kawaii (病みかわいい)** — Translates to \"sick-cute.\" A related aesthetic that combines cute, pastel elements with motifs of sickness, injury, and mental illness, such as syringes and bandages. It is considered a precursor or related style to Jirai Kei (aesthetics.fandom.com, urbandictionary.com).\n*   x11: **Kawaii (かわいい)** — The Japanese word for \"cute.\" A core component of the Jirai Kei aesthetic, which subverts traditional cuteness with darker themes (moeflavor.com).\n*   x12: **Dark Girly** — A fashion style that serves as a foundation for Jirai Kei, characterized by feminine silhouettes in darker colors like black, often with gothic accents (j-fashion.fandom.com, reddit.com).\n*   x13: **Coord / Code (コーデ / コード)** — Short for \"coordination,\" this term is used to refer to a complete outfit. It is often used in hashtags on social media to showcase fashion styles (j-fashion.fandom.com).\n*   x14: **Oshi (推し)** — Literally \"to push\" or \"endorse.\" A term from fan culture for one's favorite character, idol, or person they support. It is equivalent to the Western terms \"stan\" or \"bias\" (yumemipi.wordpress.com).\n*   x15: **Oshikatsu (推し活)** — A portmanteau of `oshi` (favorite) and `katsudou` (activities). It refers to the lifestyle and activities involved in supporting one's `oshi`, such as buying merchandise or attending events (rentablog.org).\n*   x16: **Gachi-koi (ガチ恋)** — Means \"serious love.\" In fan culture, it describes having genuine romantic feelings for an idol or character, beyond typical fandom appreciation (yumemipi.wordpress.com). This relates to the obsessive love stereotype in Jirai Kei.\n*   x17: **Wotaku (ヲタク)** — A term for a dedicated fan, often seen as having a deeper, more intense interest than a casual fan (`ファン`) (yumemipi.wordpress.com).\n*   x18: **Yandere (ヤンデレ)** — A character archetype, primarily in anime and manga, who is romantically obsessive and devoted to the point of becoming violent or unhinged. The Jirai Kei persona is often compared to this archetype (aesthetics.fandom.com).\n*   x19: **Jirai Meiku (地雷メイク)** — \"Landmine makeup.\" A specific makeup style featuring red or pink eyeshadow around the eyes to create a teary or sickly look, prominent eye-bag makeup (`namida-bukuro`), and pale skin. It became popular through online tutorials (thissidejapan.substack.com, urbandictionary.com).\n*   x20: **Sanriocore / Kuromicore** — Aesthetics centered on characters from the company Sanrio. Within Jirai Kei, characters with a slightly darker or mischievous edge, like Kuromi and My Melody, are particularly popular motifs (aesthetics.fandom.com).\n*   x21: **Pien (ぴえん)** — A Japanese slang term and emoji (🥺) used to express sadness or pleading in a cute way. `Pien-kei Joshi` (\"Pien-type girl\") is a related term for a \"cutesy and clingy girl\" (fun-japan.jp, aesthetics.fandom.com).\n*   x22: **Ryousangata (量産型)** — Literally \"mass-produced type.\" A fashion style characterized by conventionally cute, feminine, and trendy outfits that are popular among idol fans. It is often contrasted with or seen as a sister style to Jirai Kei (pienhime.tumblr.com).\n*   x23: **Tan-Oshi (単推し)** — A fan culture term for someone who is devoted to only one `oshi` (yumemipi.wordpress.com).\n*   x24: **Hako-Oshi (箱推し)** — A fan culture term for someone who supports an entire group (\"box\") rather than a single member (yumemipi.wordpress.com).\n*   x25: **DD (Daredemo Daisuki)** — An acronym for \"I love anyone,\" referring to a fan who likes multiple members in a group (yumemipi.wordpress.com).\n\n**Common themes or values:**\n*   **Aesthetic Duality:** The subculture is defined by a contrast between hyperfeminine, \"kawaii\" elements (ribbons, lace, pink, Sanrio characters) and dark, melancholic, or gothic motifs (black clothing, crosses, imagery of self-harm or substance use) (aesthetics.fandom.com, moeflavor.com).\n*   **Reclamation of Identity:** Participants often embrace the originally derogatory \"Jirai\" label, transforming it into a powerful form of self-expression and a way to identify with dark stereotypes (aesthetics.fandom.com, moeflavor.com).\n*   **Subversion of Femininity:** The aesthetic subverts traditional expectations of femininity by pairing a cute appearance with a stereotyped persona that is obsessive, emotionally volatile, and potentially violent (aesthetics.fandom.com).\n*   **Emotional Expression:** The style is described as a vehicle for expressing complex and vulnerable emotions, finding beauty in melancholy and darkness (moeflavor.com).\n*   **Obsessive Devotion:** The subculture is strongly associated with themes of obsessive love and intense dedication, linking it to idol fan culture (`oshikatsu`) and archetypes like the `yandere` (aesthetics.fandom.com).\n\n**Potential relevance or risk notes:**\nThe terms \"Jirai Onna\" and \"Jirai Kei\" originated as derogatory slang and are still widely considered insulting, used to stigmatize women as mentally unstable (j-fashion.fandom.com). The subculture's aesthetic incorporates and romanticizes imagery related to serious issues like mental illness, self-harm, and substance abuse, which can be distressing and may contribute to the trivialization of these conditions into an aesthetic (aesthetics.fandom.com, thissidejapan.substack.com). Associating a fashion style with a specific set of negative personality traits can lead to misunderstanding and prejudice against individuals who adopt the look for purely aesthetic reasons.
