So I've come across the term landmine or mine woman when looking through \nwear.jp\n today (I'm a fan of Japanese fashions). It was a tag on someone's outfit, so I clicked it and girly and goth style coords popped up. I also saw the term several weeks ago when looking at Japanese makeup videos (the girl was going a dark girly style of makeup). What exactly does this term mean? When I googled 地雷女 a bunch of dating advice articles popped up saying this is the type of woman to avoid. But it seems like an extreme stereotype and not an actual personality type. Also, girls seem to be labeling themselves/ their style with this term, but I'm not sure if they're doing it unironically or not. Is this term just a joke or is it kind of insulting (like otaku)?\n \n\n Note: I don't know how to read katakana or hiragana, I just use google translate when searching things in Japanese.\n \n\n Read more\n \n \n\n \n\n Archived post.

As \"landmine\" is almost always used in negative context towards a person and to harass or demean, there has been controversy surrounding the name.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\n While the term has seen some use in Japanese media as a sales point, it is still seen as derogatory to the degree that the staff of various companies refuse to work on anything related to the term or trend.\n[\n6\n]\n\nWomen within the subculture are called \"Jirai Joshi\" (地雷女子), or landmine girls, while men in the subculture are referred to as \"Jirai Danshi\" (地雷男子), or landmine boys.\n\nOrigins and Controversy\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nDue to a makeup challenge by Japanese YouTuber SuReRo\n[\n7\n]\n that went viral during the March 2020 corona restrictions in Japan, which was about emulating the \"landmine woman\" stereotype, the term has been associated with various darker styles, gradually morphing into its own subculture.\n[\n8\n]\n\nJirai Kei has strong associations with some darker or disturbing themes, though not in the style on its own like \nYami Kawaii\n. In this case, Jirai Kei may be associated with self-harm, drug abuse, alcoholism, street partying, illegal sex work, and other rebellious and shocking behaviors. The associations of this kind of behavior with Jirai Kei is said to have its roots among the Toyoko Kids - a criminal gang mainly consisting out of teenage runaways that is active in Kabukicho, furthering its negative connotations.\n[\n9\n]\n Many criticize that Jirai Kei has contributed to harmful real life consequences, such as teens and young adults being groomed into self-destructive behavior in order to get accepted within the subculture.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\n\nThere's also arguments to be made for the supposed appropriation of the \"landmine\" stereotype by both Japanese and overseas followers of Jirai Kei as solely a fashion trend. Elements commonly associated with the stereotype are often emulated and romanticized as a quirky gimmick solely for aesthetic reasons.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n13\n]\n Meanwhile, those who engage in substance usage, self-harm, and sex work face criticism and demonization from others into Jirai Kei, especially overseas netizens, who wish to renounce them after accusations of Jirai Kei promoting problematic behavior by outsiders.\n[\n14\n]\n In response, some contend that Jirai Kei followers who engage in problematic behavior, labeled as \"lifestyle landmines\", are the true originators of the subculture and therefore should not be disowned from the community solely for the sake of maintaining the reputation of those who insist on only participating in the associated aesthetics of the subculture, labeled as \"fashion landmines\".\n\nDue to the controversies related to the Jirai Kei subculture, people both within Japan as well overseas have stated that it should be no longer promoted in reference to styles and trends as its the fashion part is already mostly encompassed in \nDark Girly\n and \nYami Kawaii.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n15\n]\n\nStyle Basics\n[\n]\n\nJirai Kei as a style has a strong focus on the overall styling rather than the clothes on their own, and therefore the fashions worn can vary to a high degree depending on the current common trends within the subculture.\n\nClothes\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStyles commonly worn by Jirai girls over the years.\n \n \nSince the initial boom in 2020, Jirai Kei has expanded into multiple directions and now covers a wide range of styles. The classic Jirai Kei outfit features \nGirly\n fashion and emphasizes a feminine yet mysterious aura with a focus on the color combination of black with muted pink, but occasionally also red or white.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n16\n]\n High collared blouses are being worn with a frilly high waist skirt and the clothes are often accented with lace and frills.\n[\n1\n]\n An alternative winter version of the style swaps the frilly blouse with a lacey sweater. Gemstone jewelry often includes rhinestones and pearls. Some of the most popular platform shoe choices are platform loafers and, more commonly, Mary Jane platform clogs (both are usually chosen from around 3 inches to 5 inches of back heel length). Lace trim socks or dark tights are be worn under the shoes.\n\nAs the initial look associated with Jirai Kei became mainstream, it started to move on to edgier alternative fashion looks.\n[\n3\n]\n The outfits of this type are generally unisex and often incorporate oversized \nYami Kawaii\n tops with their typical prints, the most popular being depictions of sick or injured stuffed animals, that are worn like a dress and reach a little below the thigh area. There's also many \nGoth Punk\n elements with ripped sweaters, bondage elements, fishnet tights, and massive platform shoes.\n[\n17\n]\n Tracksuits are also occasionally worn in combination with leg warmers or loose socks. Black is still in the central focus for the clothes but with vibrant colors such as red, blue, or purple, as accents. \n\nHair and Makeup\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nTypical \"namida bukuro\" makeup.\n \n \n\nJirai Kei makeup often resembles a highly exaggerated version of byojaku makeup with the typical pink or red under eye blush, emphasized tear bags, down-turned black eyeliner, and overall pale makeup foundation. Black circle lens contacts are commonly worn to make the eyes appear bigger, lipstick colors can vary based on how the wearer decides.\n[\n1\n]\n\nFor hairstyles, hime cut bangs, twin-tails with the ends curled (also referred to as pigtails), and black hair with highlights are most common, though many Japanese Jirai girls also dye strands of their hair to a darker pink color, or use colored extensions. Cute nail art (black and white being the most common colors) with gems and 3D art are also usually seen, especially incorporating Sanrio themes.\n\nAccessories\n[\n]\n\nCommon accessories in Jirai Kei include long black satin hair bows, Miu Miu bracelets, variants of the saturn logo necklace from Vivienne Westwood, a Jill Stuart handbag or MCM logo backpack in pale pink, as well as various types of Sanrio character accessories, most often featuring the characters My Melody or Kuromi.\n[\n1\n]\n Miss Dior perfume bottles are also vastly popular and a common perfume choice. Older adult women invested in the fashion sense can also seen drinking various types of alcohol, like \"Strong Zero\" with a straw, presumably to not disturb their makeup.\n[\n13\n]\n\nAttitude\n[\n]\n\nOn top of the style standing out, Jirai Kei also has a unique attitude of wanting to be in charge, or pushing to be seen and recognized. This slightly rebellious attitude is often seen in those who wear the style; underage high school girls can be seen smoking, drinking, and wandering city streets at night as part of this behavior. It also has ties to even darker themes, such as public promotion of self harm and underage prostitution (see the above \nControversy\n section).\n\nPopularity\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nManga cover featuring Yua Takahashi from \"Tomorrow, I'll Be Someone's Girlfriend\" (明日、私は誰かのカノジョ)\n \n \n\nDespite Jirai Kei being a younger and controversial subculture, it has seen some rise in popularity. Particularly, it has been covered by online magazines who reported about celebrities taking part in the initial makeup challenge, as well as featured by Japanese influencers and beauty gurus who created makeup tutorials for archiving the various looks.\n[\n8\n]\n During the height of its popularity, Jirai Kei's initial style has also been worn by the popular Japanese model Tsubasa Masuwaka, and she described it as \"cute with a gothic edge\".\n[\n18\n]\n\nAlthough it hasn't gained much media traction overseas, Jirai Kei has been mentioned a bit in various English media.\n[\n8\n]\n There also has been a slight increase of general awareness about the subculture due to the drama adaption of the manga \"Tomorrow, I Will Be Someone's Girlfriend\" with the character \"Yua\" representing both the stereotype as well as the style. Music featuring Jirai Kei characters has also become popular in the mainstream, with songs such as DECO*27's \"The Vampire\" featuring Hatsune Miku dressing and acting as a landmine girl reaching nearly 70M views as of late 2023.\n[\n19\n]\n\nBrands & Shops\n[\n]\n\nAnk Rouge\n\nAmilige\n\nBubbles\n\nDarrdy\n\nDearMyLove\n\nLafary\n\nLiz Lisa\n\nMA*RS\n\nNoemie\n\nReflem\n\nRojita\n\nSubcul Zirai\n\nTravas Tokyo\n\nViviene Westwood\n\nYosuke USA\n\nGallery\n[\n]\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n↑ \n1.0\n \n1.1\n \n1.2\n \n1.3\n \n\"Appearing all over Kabukicho!

It is primarily associated with young people frequenting the nightlife of Kabukichō. Initially, the style closely resembled the darker variant of \nJapanese Girly\n fashion during its peak popularity, but it has since evolved to incorporate a wider range of styles.\n\nThe subculture carries a stereotype: young women who adopt this cute, hyperfeminine yet dark fashion are perceived to have personalities that contradict their appearance. Instead of being sweet and demure, they are often stereotyped as violent and obsessive (akin to a \nYandere\n), engaging in self-harm, and having habits of heavy drinking or smoking.\n\nJapanese brands have rapidly adapted to this trend, with Western brands influenced by Kawaii culture also following suit.\n\nContents\n\n1\n \nHistory\n\n2\n \nVisuals\n\n3\n \nFashion\n\n3.1\n \nTops\n\n3.2\n \nBottoms\n\n3.3\n \nShoes and Legwear\n\n3.4\n \nAccessories\n\n3.5\n \nHair and Makeup\n\n4\n \nMedia\n\n4.1\n \nLiterature\n\n4.2\n \nManga\n\n4.3\n \nTelevision\n\n4.4\n \nVideo Games\n\n5\n \nMusic\n\n5.1\n \nSongs\n\n5.2\n \nPlaylists\n\n6\n \nCriticism\n\n7\n \nResources\n\n7.1\n \nBlogs\n\n7.2\n \nVendors\n\n8\n \nGallery\n\n9\n \nReferences\n\n10\n \nNavigation\n\nHistory\n[\n]\n\nThe term \"Jirai Kei\" is derived from \"\nJirai Onna\n\" (地雷女), literally \"landmine woman,\" a derogatory term used to stereotype women, particularly those with mental illnesses such as Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), bipolar disorder, and other mood swing-inducing conditions, as a \"ticking time bomb.\" This term is often employed to dismiss women, frequently ex-girlfriends, as \"crazy\" or \"dangerous\" based on arbitrary traits, such as an affinity for kawaii aesthetics. Within the subculture, women are referred to as \"\nJirai Joshi\n\" (地雷女子), or \"landmine girls,\" while men are called \"\nJirai Danshi\n\" (地雷男子), or \"landmine boys.\"\n\nThe subculture became associated with various darker fashion styles following a \"psycho girlfriend\" dress-up challenge that gained viral traction during the March 2020 COVID-19 restrictions in Japan.\n[\n1\n]\n This challenge frequently referenced traits commonly associated with the Toyoko Kids, a group primarily composed of young runaway teenagers, some of whom were groomed online by older men with promises of a better life in the Kabukicho red-light district. These individuals are often exploited for sex work, drug trafficking, and other criminal activities.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\n\nWhile Western followers of Jirai Kei often attempt to separate it from its darker origins by viewing it solely as a fashion trend, the subculture largely retains a negative public image within Japan. Its associations with the \"psycho girlfriend\" trope are interpreted as a misogynistic stereotype, yet Japanese girls who identify as \"landmine\" fully embrace it.\n[\n4\n]\n This misunderstanding stems from several factors: the language barrier hindering accurate interpretation of Japanese articles and social media posts, a lack of awareness regarding the perception of mental health issues in Japan, and brands capitalizing on the subculture's popularity by using \"Jirai Kei\" as a marketing term, regardless of whether their products are genuinely associated with it.\n\nVisuals\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExample of a heavily edited selfie by @hiudayonn.\n \n \n\nGirls in this subculture add \nheavy filters and edits\n to their photos. Pale pink and white filters can add a slight haze to all of their images, and they are often decorated in \nvirtual stickers\n with Jirai Kei motifs. They also use \nface and body editing\n to the point of an unnatural appearance. Impossibly large eyes with anime proportions, making skin more pale, and making their bodies thinner and longer are extremely common in photos. This is with the goal of appearing eerie and puppy-eyed, diverging from the trend of \"pien\" makeup on Japanese tiktok. The color palettes of Jirai Kei is mainly white, black and pastel pink, though on occasion red, blue and grey is also used. \n\nTo contrast all of the sweet and girly visuals, violent imagery is often shown. \nBox-cutters, razors, and pockets knives\n are commonly featured in outfit posts. The stereotype is that a landmine girl would use it to threaten her boyfriend if he upsets her, or that she engages in self-harm. Additionally, these cute girls often pose with \nfake guns\n (firearms are illegal in Japan), cigarettes, or \nalcohol and energy drinks\n (from Strong Zero and Monster Energy) with straws, presumably to protect their lipstick while drinking. Many photos have color-scheme matching energy drink cans, and it is even popular to stack and glue the cans in the shape of machine guns. Similar to Yami Kawaii, there is often medical imagery of \npills and syringes\n, usually paired with narcotics and synthetic drugs. \n\nSanrio is strongly associated with the \nKawaii\n, girly, and consumer culture in Japan. As a result, girls into Jirai Kei are also associated with these characters, specifically \nKuromi\n and My Melody\n. People in this subculture own and take photos of plushies of these characters and own an assortment of merchandise, such as backpacks, pencil pouches, etc. themed around these characters. Sanrio has taken notice and even released Jirai Kei-inspired plushies of Kuromi and My Melody. Another character that can be associated is Menhera-chan, the suicidal magical girl that popularized \nYami Kawaii\n. Her artist has drawn her in stereotypical outfits, and her self-destructive habits could be relatable for those in the subculture. \n\nThere's also many artists engaging with the subculture who draw \nanime-style illustrations\n of landmine girls wearing the typical outfits while in stereotypical situations, such as taking selfies, holding a can while squatting on the streets, or having a mental breakdown. Jirai Kei followers often repost these \ndrawings on social media\n. \n\nFashion\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe various styles worn by jirai girls illustrated featuring Blue Archive characters. \n \n \n\nThe styles associated with Jirai Kei are constantly changing with the core defining trait being that the fashion is worn by landmine girls. Comparable to \nE-Girl\n’s style, while landmine girls may wear many different fashion styles, there is a main look typically associated with the aesthetic that evolved out of a mix of several different alternative genres. The initial look associated with the Jirai Kei subculture derived from \nJapanese Girly fashion\n and \nYami Kawaii\n, however outfits consisting out of \nGoth Punk\n, \nJersey Maid\n, and darker general \nalternative\n fashion have also been popular among its followers. As the trends within Jirai Kei keep on changing, many brands mimic one another and release mix-and-match variations for the various styles worn. The fabric of the clothes tends to be on the more synthetic side, with the quality not being that high, on account of them often being made by fast fashion companies who constantly adopt to the latest trends. \n\nRegardless of the style worn, the idea is to appear cute yet mature, but with an dark aura. \n\nThe ultra-feminine Jirai style has also evolved since its inception. As the style developed, the details of the style increased, with certain trends being more or less popular as certain garments from specific brands became viral. \n\nTops\n[\n]\n\nThe most common tops are \nblouses with ultra-feminine details\n that may slightly resemble \nLolita Fashion.\n Peter Pan and sailor collars, ruffles, lace trim, puffed sleeves, cold-shoulders, contrasting buttons are some tropes that are featured in the blouses. Alternative outfits use coat-dresses instead, and winter outfits utilize knit sweaters. Girls also often \ntie ribbons or add bow brooches with rhinestone or pearl-accented faux jewels\n at the neck. \n\nSome brands have also released \noversized tees and sweatshirts\n that can fit in with this aesthetic. They often have a print with a stereotypical motif, English text, anime prints, etc. These also contain feminine details, but less often. For example, there may be eyelets for lacing ribbon through, zippers, or detachable Peter Pan collars. This resembles the fashion of the \nYami Kawaii\n aesthetic, and contributes to an edgier and less girly look. Jirai boys add masculine or androgynous elements to this style, while girls like to pair these tops with chunky sneakers and necklaces. \n\nA trend that appeared approximately 2023 is the set-up, which is a two-piece set consisting of a \ntunic-length top with a matching pair of micro-shorts\n, with the aim of it looking like an extra-short dress, with the shorts being for modesty purposes. This top would have the same details as the blouses. \n\nBottoms\n[\n]\n\nHigh waisted mini skirts\n are by far the most popular bottom. The silhouette can be flared, trapezoid or pleated. \nSilver hardware details\n such as heart-shaped belt buckles, eyelets, and zippers add edge to the outfit and contrast the lace and girly details of the blouse. But there are also ruffles, ribbon lacing to resemble a corset, and ruffled suspenders to add girliness. \nShorts\n can also be featured in this aesthetic, as well as \nlonger flowy skirts\n. However, they are both comparatively rare to the mini skirts. Usually the bottoms are black while the top is pink or white, though sometimes this is flipped. \n\nThe more casual \nJersey Maid\n and \nYami Kawaii\n inspired looks can also have \ntrack pants\n like ones from Adidas as a pairing with a track suit jacket or oversized tee or sweatshirt. \n\nShoes and Legwear\n[\n]\n\nBecause the legs are most often exposed in this style, \nlace or fishnet stockings\n are worn, and could be switched or even doubled up with \nruffled or lace ankle socks\n. \n\nThe shoes are most commonly \nplatform loafers or multi-strapped mary janes\n, and most girls buy their shoes from BUBBLES Tokyo, DearMyLove, Liz Lisa and others. The shoes can be \nmore decorated,\n with faux jewels, ribbon laces, rhinestone buckles and silver cross charms. \n\nAccessories\n[\n]\n\nThe most popular bags are \ntotes and mini backpacks\n. Usually, they're pink or black, sometimes adorned with ribbons and bows with plushies or Sanrio figurine keychains attached. The most popular mini backpacks on social media are the studded MCM mini packpack and Melody Maison de Fleur totes. Other girls may instead use bags from \npopular luxury brands\n.\n\nAside from ribbons and bows, there is not much jewelry involved in Jirai Kei. Most styles include only earrings or neckwear like chokers, piercings and necklaces. A popular trend is the Viviene Westwood orb necklace. Because of the color scheme, many girls avoid gold jewelry and opt for silver.\n\nHair and Makeup\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAn illustration of the typical hairstyles by \nAkagumi-chan\n.\n \n \n\nHime-cut bangs,\n which are straight bangs across the forehead with side bangs around chin-length, are extremely popular amongst young women in Japan in general as it is an easy way to archive the illusion of a small face. It fits in with the ultra-feminine style. Because these women are Japanese and around high school age, the \nmost common hair color is black\n, since dyed hair is not allowed in schools. However, some girls add \nhighlights that can be bleached blonde or in different shades of pink.\n\nIn terms of styling, \npigtails\n (also called twin tails), are the majority hairstyle. They can be either low or high, with high pigtails often being \nhalf-up half-down\n. Girls often curl the ends and decorate these twin tails with \nribbons and bows\n, often with the same faux jewels on their brooches. Other \nhair accessories\n such as rectangle headdresses, headbands with faux jewels, and bobby pins with charms are popular too. \n\nFor the eye makeup, the most popular is an exaggerated version of the \"\nnamida bukuro\n\" makeup style where the \ntear bags\n are emphasized to look puffy as if the wearer is about to cry, which is further highlighted with pink undereye blush. The additional effect of appearing sickly is also desired. The \neyeliner is downturned to give a more \"puppy-like\"\n , feminine and sad appearance. \n\nFace and lip makeup are equally pink, with \nblush and sparkly highlighter being high\n on the cheekbones. \nLip makeup has a wide variation\n, with some looks being more matte, some glossy, some sculpted, some even. \n\nMany additional cosmetic products are also used for exaggerated features. \nFake lashes\n are generally popular in Japan, and in Jirai Kei, they are longer and spikier. \nDark circle lenses\n are also popular, and serve to make the eyes look bigger and anime-like. \n\nLong acrylic nails\n are also popular and often feature lace patterns, faux jewels, corset lacing, crosses, as well as stereotypical motifs like the pleading face emoji. \n\nMedia\n[\n]\n\nLiterature\n[\n]\n\nHost Madness\n - Oizumi Rika\n\nKabukicho Moratorium\n - Chiwawa Sasaki\n\nPeople Who Overdose\n - Chiwawa Sasaki\n\nThe Disease of Pien: Consumption and Approval of the SNS Generation\n - Chiwawa Sasaki\n\nManga\n[\n]\n\nAshita, Watashi wa Dareka no Kanojo - Tomorrow, I'll Be Someone's Girlfriend\n\nAndroid wa Jirai-kei no Yume wo Miru - Android Dreams of a Jirai Kei Girl\n\nKiken na Ren'ai - Dangerous Love\n\nKimi ni Aisarete Itakatta - It Hurts To Be Loved By You\n\nJirai Kareshi - My Boyfriend's a Ticking Time Bomb\n\nJirai-kei JK to Onee-chan no Hanashi - The Landmine Girl and Her Sister\n\nJirai Ninja Ruru no Shitsuren - Jirai Ninja Ruru's Heartbreak\n\nKakaKano - Dating the Kind of Girl You Shouldn't Get Involved With\n\nKoi wa Jirai wo Funde kara - A Love That Begins After Stepping On A Mine\n\nMitame Jirai-kei Osananajimi - My Childhood Friend Looks Like A Landmine But Isn't\n\nYamaarashi no Shisha (ヤマアラシのシーシャ)\n\nZenma (銭麻)\n\nTelevision\n[\n]\n\nAshita, Watashi wa Dareka no Kanojo\n\nCinderella Complex\n\nIshiko and Haneo: You're Suing Me?\n (episode 7)\n\nThe Black Swindler (episode 8)\n\nVideo Games\n[\n]\n\nJIRAIYA\n\nNeedy Streamer Overload\n\nSentimental Deathloop\n\nSuteki na Kanojo no Tsukurikata\n\nYandere ura Kano Jirai-chan\n\nYamikore\n\nLove Angel Syndrome\n\nMusic\n[\n]\n\nSongs\n[\n]\n\nAlice*Iris - Daikirai Lie Suki\n\nAlice*Iris - Gimme Me Love\n\nAmu - Pien Syndrome\n\nAmu - Mekka Warning\n\nCagayake - Unleash\n\nChilldspot - Ai Ai\n\nDECO*27 - The Vampire\n\nIsana - Menhera Janai Mon!\n\nHoneyWorks - Kawaikute Gomen\n\nKuraisekai - So Pien My Life\n\nKAFU - Egonomy\n\nKai - Unicorn Girl\n\nKai - Lose the Princess\n\nKairiki Bear - Darling Dance\n\nKareki Kashiwagi - Ikayaki-Wristed Girl\n\nLiLiPi - Shukipi Overdose\n\nMagnetite Hiiragi feat.

There are strong associations with mental illness, self harm, drug usage, sex work, underage prostitution, and other uncomfortable subjects. The negative aspects of the \"landmine\" stereotype are often emulated and romanticized as a quirky gimmick solely for aesthetic reasons.\n[\n5\n]\n On Twitter in particular, it's not uncommon for followers of the subculture to constantly promote self-destructive behaviour, the accounts often being part of \nshtwt\n (self-harm twitter) and \nedtwt\n (eating disorder twitter).\n[\n4\n]\n There's also a strong association with \"bangya\" culture with landmine girls also being stereotyped as groupies who are obsessive over their favorite bands and music artists to an unhealthy degree.\n\nAnother problem is the fetishization of the \"landmine\" stereotype, which is a glimpse into the wider topic of sexualizing women who exhibit mental illness. It is problematic for its ableist rhetoric claiming mentally-ill women to be \"freaky\", \"hot but crazy\" and more desirable sexually and emotionally, as well as its infantalistic undertone of these women being more emotionally attached and dependent on their lover's affection.\n[\n6\n]\n This fetishization of mentally ill women and use of the femme-fatale archetype ignores the unpleasant nuances of suffering from BPD or bipolar disorder and targets women who are mentally vulnerable to emotionally abusive, power-imbalanced relationships.\n[\n7\n]\n\nThere also have been issues caused by the strong associations with the host culture of Kabukicho. As people of any age can enter those establishments as long as no alcohol is served, male hosts have been actively going for young girls to spend money on them in exchange for affection, often resulting in the girls resorting to \"papa katsu\" (sugar-daddying) in order to afford their host club addiction.\n[\n8\n]\n\nBecause the clothes worn are often very brand specific, some Jirai Kei netizens suggest that there is slight elitism in the community for purchasing items from the \"correct\" stores, regardless of if the price can be prohibitively expensive, particularly for western followers that endure high shipping fees from Japanese brand proxies. On social media, especially on TikTok, some argue that this brand-focused side of Jirai Kei encourages hyper consumerism and trend-cycling while the same is also said for those who buy cheap replica items from problematic fast fashion stores like Shein/Romwe. \n\nAs the subculture can't be separated from its problematic parts precisely because they are what make Jirai Kei what it is, many have argued that its name shouldn't be used in a throwaway manner in reference to styles or trends in order to not expose strangers to potential triggering content. \n\nResources\n[\n]\n\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\nFor further reading, please read its \npage\n on the Jfashion Wiki. \n\nBlogs\n[\n]\n\nZirai Bijyo\n\nSubcul Zirai\n\nZirai Zyoshi\n\nVendors\n[\n]\n\nAnk Rouge\n\nAmilige\n\nBubbles\n\nDarrdy\n\nDearMyLove\n\nLafary\n\nLIZ LISA\n\nMA*RS\n\nNoemie\n\nReflem\n\nRojita\n\nSubcul Zirai\n\nTravas Tokyo\n\nViviene Westwood\n\nYosuke USA\n\nGallery\n[\n]\n\nキャンメイク縛り地雷メイク【イエベ・茶髪OK】\nA makeup tutorial\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n↑\n \nAbsolutely the largest eyes!!

Welcome to This Side of Japan, a newsletter about Japanese music, new and old! \nYou can check out previous issues here\n.\nCW: Depression, mental health\nA casual browse at Japanese rock music in the 2010s might lead you to the descriptor \nmenhera—\na shorthand for the manic depressive among other behaviors related to poor mental health. A quick Google search of “\nmenhera \nrock” will return some blog posts going back to at least 2015, including \na playlist made in 2017 at streaming site KKBox\n compiling songs that fit in this would-be subgenre or another list from last year titled “\npopular \nmenhera\n songs for karaoke\n.”\nIt’s one thing to group sad songs to get over a break up as the latter list did, collecting songs by Kana Nishino, Ringo Shiina and Aimyon. Labeling the music with a loaded word like \nmenhera, \nhowever, is simply insensitive, if not disturbing in the way it flattens depression into a supposedly recognizable aesthetic. But trivializing mental illness in such a manner is a phenomenon perpetuated to this day in Japanese culture one way or another through bands like Milky Way—who frequently comes up in these \nmenhera\n rock lists—still using it as a hashtag for \ntheir new music\n or the recent viral meme of \njirai meiku\n—\na red-based make-up style to mimic the look of a \njirai jyoshi,\n or a girl who appears fine on the surface but actually unstable.\nThe ease in which \nmenhera\n is thrown partly has to do with the word’s origin as internet slang. First appearing in the 2010s, the term is a portmanteau of \nmentaru herusu\n, or mental health, added with the suffix of -er that was first used to refer to people perusing the mental health threads on 2chan, according to \nWeblio\n.\nThe term made its way into music early on that decade as well. Another popular rock band in these lists, Mio Yamazaki uploaded “\nMenhera\n” to YouTube in 2013, and the song illustrates the common sensibilities exhibited by those who get grouped as \nmenhera\n rock. The lyrical content is more emotionally frank, depressive, and aggressive compared to the average pop song. The verses ignore pop brevity and instead like to go on long-winded. The scrolling lyric video not only gets at how much the lyrics bleed over the margins but also how it resembles raw internet text, either on forums, IMs or iPhone conversations, thrown onto music. I imagine this is how an unlikely candidate like the acoustic-guitar-carrying Aimyon can get lumped into a list like this, through her Line-inspired music video for “\nAnatakaiboujyunaika ~Shine~\n”—or “The Dissection of You as a Love Song: Die.”\nIt’s unfortunate that these artists get grouped under such a crass category because their music itself is valuable in the way it taps into topics then not often found in mainstream pop. Not only do these artists not hold back from voicing emotions like depression, obsession and self-loathing, they present them as ugly and messy as they feel. The guitar riffs are often jagged, sometimes woven in complicated knots, while the singers don’t care if their voices are abrasive compared to the average pop singer. The misshapen qualities as well as their intensity only make the music feel more visceral and personal.\nWhile commonalities within in this type of music might emerge, establishing a subgenre for these works just creates more issues. Identifying these modes of expression as genre tropes flatten the perception of the music. Rounding the artists under a term such as \nmenhera\n only attaches stigma to not only the types of conversation they start but the methods in which they express those topics. It’s worth mentioning quite a few acts that people fit into this category are either women or voiced by women, who are also subjected to adjacent terms such as \njirai-onna\n and \nmenhera joshi\n more than men. “When I express sadness or anger, I’m told ‘ you’re \nmenhera\n,’ when I try to speak with logic, I’m told ‘that’s not cute,’” \nHaru Nemuri tweeted in 2018\n. Popularizing the describing of music as \nmenhera\n only creates more misogynistic ways to shut down art made by women.\nDuring the latter half of the decade, artists whose music get described as \nmenhera\n seems to have accepted just how vapid the term has become. “I found a tweet recently that said, ‘I’m \nmenhera\n so I listened to Seiko Oomori’ with a lot of emojis on it,” \nSeiko Oomori said to Cinra in 2016\n. “\nMenhera\n doesn’t mean much. People who actually take medication aren’t listening to my songs.” The term has taken a similar life to how the word “depression” has been used on social media with ironic distance making it meaningless as much as it made its topics easier to discuss.\nThe problematic treatment might complicate the perception of the music, but the works of these artists still manage to leave a sizable impact for the future. The more depressive themes seem not only more commonplace in pop but also more accessible in recent years. The conversations stemming from these themes appear on rather unassuming pop at least relative to the more intense music that came before. You can definitely chalk up the change in attitude to the uncertain times, but part of that I think also has to do with these artists who confronted these dark emotions in their music despite whatever insensitive name they were being called.\n***\nPhew! A longer essay to start this issue, so I’ll keep it short here. Album of the Week is technically not so new, but I have my reasons why it’s there. Please enjoy the singles but please do enjoy the Oricon revisit, especially if you like Yellow Magic Orchestra. Happy listening!\nAlbum of the Week\nDeep Blue\n by Sora Tob Sakana [NBC Universal]\nRecommended track: “\nSignal\n” \n| \nListen to it on \nSpotify\nThe trajectory of Sora Tob Sakana in the past year has felt a tad uncertain after a member’s graduation reducing the idol group down to a trio, but their music has been more promising than ever. The lack of predictability in their future translated to something more creatively optimistic with last year’s full-length, \nWorld Fragment Tour\n, suggesting that their already-well-defined math-rock sound still had a lot more room to grow. It was a shock, then, to hear the group announce that they will disband this fall after releasing what will be their last full-length album, \nDeep Blue\n.\nAdmittedly, \nDeep Blue\n is not entirely new. While it is bookended by two new songs, “\nSignal\n” and “\nUntie\n,” the rest consists of re-recording of old songs, a good half pulled from their self-titled 2016 album. The new context that surrounds the group, however, transforms the songs from their original state. Familiar lyrics now bear new meanings, and the awe-inspiring music functions with a different purpose. \nDeep Blue\n resonates deeper than just a greatest-hits collection, offering a second look at Sora Tob Sakana’s most cherished songs.\nThe group’s early songs thrived off of innocence and naivete. Part of that came from the idols’ own lack of context with the music they worked with. “In the beginning, we actually sang and performed without understanding that the songs were difficult,” \nFuuka Kanzaki said\n about recording their tracks produced by Yoshimasa Terui, who also leads math-rock-inspired bands such as siraph. Led by their meek voices, Sora Tob Sakana’s self-titled album brought an experience as though you were discovering these new sounds and emotions alongside them. Those sounds unfurl even more vividly thanks to the album’s remastering job, the guitars benefiting the most as the tinny riffs get restored so they can shine as vibrant and dynamic as they should.\nChildish innocence fades away from those familiar songs as they return with more experience but also the foresight of their imminent split. The exuberant music once suggested a lush world full of infinite possibilities; now, that same exuberance instead communicates their time rapidly slipping away. “Tick, tock, time still passes by / No one can stop it / Like it will probably go on forever / I’m not a kid anymore.” Such lyrics hits poignant now with their numbered days in mind, and even more when you realize it comes from their first-ever single, “\nYozora Wo Zenbu\n.”\nIt’s bittersweet to consider that Sora Tob Sakana’s early triumphs have also become their swan song, but \nDeep Blue\n ultimately sings a life well lived rather than wallowing in melancholy. The rock music, a mix of wide-eyed electronica and zipping math-rock, still explodes with inimitable energy, and the added polish to the production pumps even more soul for the group’s last hurrah. The idols’ voices, too, have grown sharper, showing off more control of their complex surroundings. Not only do they sound wiser when it comes to articulating their emotions, the three seem unfazed whenever they sing lyrics about the overwhelming speed of life. Sora Tob Sakana accept their time has come to an end, and their embrace of finality inspires a whole new perspective of their music.\nSingles Club\n“Cream” by macominaming [Oiran Music]\nMacominaming’s latest track lulls in and out of a comforting slumber as the glowing synths hum a sleepy tune. The indie-pop duo, too, seems deep in a their dreams as the two softly whisper a verse about how they can’t tell up from down. Their stroll through the subconscious sounds like a delight especially as they get to the hook, stretching out the long syllable of the titular word like sweet taffy.\nListen to the single on \nBandcamp\n.\nSee also:\n “\nSettee\n” by Newly ft. Kojikoji; “\nAfter Five\n” by O’chawanz\n“Yes and No” by Dreams Come True [Universal Sigma]\nI started watching the medical TV drama \nUnsung Cinderella: Midori, The Hospital Pharmacist\n about a few weeks ago. The episodes remain pretty earnest without too many pockets of comedy, and so I expected a theme song from Dreams Come True that’s just as sincere and sentimental—a mood that the duo have historically nailed with their collection of drama-theme-turned-hits. But as the episode entered its final sappy moments, I noticed, hey, do I hear a break beat? Considering the duo’s \njolly \nasadora\n entry\n from last year, a sly inclusion of drum breaks was a big curve ball that I had to investigate a bit further.\n“Yes and No” really is one of the edgiest singles to come from the J-pop veterans. R&B has been their foundation since the ‘90s, but the fancy electronic production here is something else. The retro new wave could be easily re-fitted into a synthwave track; if you enjoyed the icy Vangelis synths of The Weeknd’s \nAfter Hours\n, the sleek, cinematic flair of this single should also excite. Miwa Yoshida and her soulful vocals gel well with the lush music, adding a golden feel as though “Yes and No” is a lost pop hit from the opulent ‘80s.\nListen to the single on \nSpotify\n.\nSee also:\n “\nUtopia\n” by AAAMYYY; “\nNight D\n” by Eill\n“Snooze” by Zombie-Chang [Roman Label / Bayon Production]\nMeirin Yung has been playing with electro this year, releasing the resulting one-offs on her YouTube page, and the synth-twiddling experiments come to full fruition in her new Zombie-Chang album, \nTake Me Away from Tokyo\n. The spastic electronics such as the one firing off in “Snooze” initially made for more extroverted music relative to her previous output, which seemed conflicting at first with what I enjoy about Yung’s songs. My favorite singles of hers try and fail at fighting against inertia, never quite reaching full catharsis.\nThe more I immerse myself into the wonky sounds, however, the song becomes as hypnotic as her previous releases with the crowding of noise inviting sensory paralysis. The overwhelm is fitting for such a song with Yung wandering in a half-asleep state while a buzzing alarm echoes in the distance—”gotta shut it off,” she repeats in her signature dead-pan cadence as the iPhone ringer incessantly beeps.\nTake Me Away from Tokyo \nis out now. Listen to it on \nSpotify\n.\nSee also:\n “\nMurmur\n” by Pasocom Music Club; “\nTurbulence\n” by Wata Igarashi\nThis Week in 1981…\n“High School Lullaby” by Imo-Kin Trio [For Life, 1981]\nNo. 1 during the weeks of Aug. 24 - Oct. 5, 1981\n | \nListen to it on \nYouTube\nThe Oricon charts truly feel like the Wild West sometimes with it allowing space for an act like Imo-Kin Trio to climb up to number one. None of the three in the group are musicians but instead talents in entertainment, who starred as regulars in the variety TV program \nKindon! Yoiko Waruiko Futsunoko\n. While TV spawned hits either through a drama series or audition programs, Imo-Kin Trio was one of the first where a variety show assembled their talents to debut a pop group. \nThe resulting debut single “High School Lullaby” provides a neat look at what was trendy in Japanese pop at the time in 1981. Imo-Kin Trio’s name is a portmanteau of YMO, or Yellow Magic Orchestra, and Johnny’s idol group Tanokin Trio, and the group’s initial make-up essentially resembles what you’d imagine as the other end of that bizarre boy-band formula. The former’s Haruomi Hosono produced the music; the technopop new wave is definitely the work of the master, down to the drum-machine count-in that echoes “\nRydeen\n.” The three sing about their one-sided crush over the skipping electronic beat, the chorus featuring one saccharine hook: “\nbaby, I love you / so suki suki baby\n,” they call out in unison.\nThe origin story sets a precedent for a lot of the future TV-born novelty hits in the Oricon. The trio loosely stands as a reference for something like the music career of comedy duo Tunnels, whose star status retroactively feeds into the appeal of the music that they put out on the side during the ‘80s and early ‘90s. The launch of Imo-Kin definitely cast a shadow over the novelty records that came straight from the segments of the Heisei variety program \nTunnels No Minasan No Okagedeshita\n: the debut of Yaen in 1998 from the show essentially updates the YMO rip of “High School Lullaby” into \na Kinki Kids parody\n.\nThe difference with Imo-Kin is that the members had just got into television with \nKindon!\n and so “High School Lullaby” is propelled more by the trendiness of YMO than necessarily the star power of the involved talents. Conversely, though, it goes to show how the world of Japanese television can launch just about any music career through sheer synergy even if the talents in question have little ambitions to establish themselves in the music realm.

{"url": "https://yumemipi.wordpress.com/2020/05/29/oshi-terms-101-a-guide/", "title": "Oshi Terms 101 : A Guide – Yumemipi's Outlet ♥", "text": "Oshi Terms 101 : A Guide – Yumemipi's Outlet ♥\n\nSkip to content\n\nIf you’re a beginner in the idol scene, wotaku community, or maybe someone who’s curious about these things, it gets confusing because there are a lot of terminologies and slang that are flying around across the internet.\nI remember being really clueless and had little to no idea of what these meant until I talked to some of my japanese friends (who are also into 2d idols) and they walked me through the whole experience and of course, did some research on my own as well. Though there are a lot of words and the list just goes on and on, I chose the basic ones and what I think would be interesting for everyone to know!\n\nNow the big question:\n WHAT THE HELL IS AN OSHI?\n\n• Oshi (推し/おし)\n\n– the word oshi literally means\n “push”\n but it is now the common term used for people who is a fan of something or someone.\n– can also be referred to a person who likes a group or a person who likes a certain member.\n– also commonly known as \n“stan/bias”\n in western fan terms.\nExample:\n私はABC推しです ➡️ (I am a fan of ABC)\n推しはAさん➡️ (The person I am a fan of is A-san)\n***Do note that the word ‘Oshi’ is widely used not only in the idol scene but also actors, voice actors, anime/game characters and so much more!***\n\n• \nTan-Oshi (単推し/たんおし)\n\n– term used for someone who’s only loyal to one person or member.\n– this is also popularly known as \n“Top Oshi”\n\n• Hako-Oshi (箱推し/はこおし)\n\n– literally means \n“Box Push”\n– it is the term use to liking all members of a group.\nTo simply break it down:\n箱 (hako) ➡️ the whole group\n推し (oshi) ➡️ support\n\n• Oshi Kaburi (推し被り)\n\n– this refers to having the same oshi as an another fan.\n\n•\n DD\n\n– means “\nD\naredemo \nD\naisuki”\n– this refer to fans who doesn’t have one favorite member in a group but rather loves multiple members of the group.\n– also most commonly known as “multi-fandom”.\n\n• Wotaku (ヲタク)\n\n– it is mostly abbreviated as \nヲタ\n which means fan.\nファン\n (fan) is the common mainstream term. BUT!!\nヲタク\n (wotaku) has more deeper feel than being just a ‘fan’.\nAn example situation for Fan VS Wotaku:\nFan ➡️ “He is handsome. I like him.”\nWotaku ➡️ “He is so handsome!!! I’M CRYING I LOVE HIM SO MUCH!!! Ahhh ;;; “\n//That kind of feeling! LOL\n\n• Onna wota-wota (女ヲタヲタ)\n\n– means “Female fan’s fans” //I know sounds weird.\n– this term is referred to someone who does not like the idol/group but rather who likes their female fans instead.\n– mostly seen going to the live concert site not to watch and support the idols but to see their female fans. YIKES. PLS ALWAYS BE CAREFUL!\n\n• Gachi-koi (ガチ恋/がちこい)\n\n– means falling in love with their oshi.\n– transformed from being just an ordinary fan to really want to fall in love with them.\n– this is mostly used by male fans.\n\n• Riako (リアコ)\n\n– it’s a short term for “I’m in real love” / “\nRia\nru ni \nKo\ni shiteru” (リアルに恋してる)\n– Riako and Gachi-koi have similar meanings but this is only used by female fans.\n\n•\n Kenashi Ai (貶し愛/けなしあい)\n\n– this means saying hateful words/hating the person you like but deep inside it is a form of expressing your love for them aka “Playful rudeness”. Much like a Tsundere(??) LOLOL\n– pretty common thing for this is making memes out of their oshi’s /ugly/ faces or expressions.\n\n• Niwaka Ame (にわか雨)\n\n– it is used as a negative connotation for people who became fans only because of a sudden surge of popularity of a certain series/group but then it dies down when the hype is not there anymore aka most commonly known as the “mainstreamers”.\n\nThe “niwaka” is written in kanji as 「\n俄\n」 which means “suddenly”.\nThe word \n‘niwaka ame’\n in japanese means\n ‘rain shower’\n and just like rain showers it pours then it stops. In addition to that, ‘niwaka’ is also an abbreviation for the theatre act called \n“Niwaka Kyogen”\n an on the spot type of play that was held on the streets during Edo period and was very popular during at that time.\nThere is no negative element in the word “niwaka” but the fan term for it is becoming more common nowadays. Please do refrain from using it to other fans!\n\n• MIHA (ミーハー)\n\n– has similar meaning to ‘niwaka’\n– this refers to people who are easily influenced\n– aka follower of new trends\nA situational example for that is when originally, you were not interested in liking this certain group/idol (or even a series) but everyone around you was very into it so you checked it out and became a fan.\nThere are many theories for the etymology of this word so I will present 3 of those!\n1. During Showa Era, there were many young women whose name starts with “mi” (み) and “ha” (は). Those who were called “Mi-chan” and “Ha-chan” are referred to as young women who are obsessed with their hobbies and had little to no educational background. Nowadays, it’s also used thoroughly among men.\n2. It’s a combination of the popular japanese dessert called “Mitsumame” and an old stage name of a well known Showa actor, “Chojiro Hayashi”\n3. It comes from the words “Me” and “Her” in the english language.\n\n• Resu (レス)\n\n– means response\n– refers to the idol’s response to you during events or live concerts, such as waving at you or doing what’s written in your “uchiwa”!\n\n• All Pass (ぜんつう)\n\n– someone who participates in all concerts and activities of their oshi hence the term ‘All Pass’\n\n• Jizou (地蔵/じぞう)\n\n– someone who’s at the event/live concert and just quietly looks at the idols and performers\n– basically motionless\n\n• Kakoi (囲い/かこい)\n\n– someone who’s watching a live stream and spams in the comment section in an attempt to attract the attention of the one who’s broadcasting.\n\n•\n Pile Up (積む積み/つむつみ)\n\n– a fan who bought too many copies of the same cd/merchandise\n– this is very common for fans especially when purchasing \n\n• Number of Goods = Love\n\n– its called\n グッズ量参戦歴 = 愛\n but ofc that wouldn’t make sense when I translate it word by word LOL i think??? don’t sue me pls\n– basically this means “The number of merchandise you have of your oshi/ how many times you participated in concerts = LOVE”\nA gentle reminder that not buying merchs of your oshi’s doesn’t make you less any of a fan! I’ve heard from other’s experiences that they are starving themselves and would rather buy merchs and sacrifice buying their own personal needs. I have totally nothing against buying merchs because if it makes you happy, then go for it. I know the experience all too well since I love collecting and buying merch as well.\nBut PLEASE prioritize your money when you have to!\n\n• Takai (他界/たかい)\n\n– can also mean “another world” or “graduate”\n(Ex: I have graduated from being a fan of this group. )\n– refers to someone who has stopped being a fan due to various reasons.\n\n• Kamitaiou (神対応/かみたいおう)\n\n– aka “God’s Response”\n– refers to an idol who has a good response to fans.\nAn example for this is when an idol reads fanmails from fans and shares his thoughts.\n\n• Shiotaiou (塩対応/しおたいおう)\n\n– basically the opposite of “kamitaiou”\n\n• Hair Make (ヘアメク)\n\n– just as the name suggests, its about styling hair! This is very popular among female fans and they usually go to the salon to make their hair look cute and stylish before a live concert or even when they just hang out with their friends.\nIn hair make you can put your oshi accessories! Think of it like an itabag, but for hair!\nPrice ranges about from ¥2000-¥5,000 om an average but it usually depends on the salon and how complex the style that you want to achieve ♡\n\n• Oshi Ga Toutoi (推しが尊い)\n\n– means “My Oshi is precious”\nWhen you look up at the dictionary the word \n「尊い」\n means precious. However, the meaning is different now that it is a word that cannot be expressed by mere words alone and shows the highest degree form of liking your oshi.\nIt is an emotion that goes beyond “like” and “love” and is now on the level of loyalty and faith.\nThis word contains many meanings but has the same concept around it!\n\n⋆ ˚｡⋆୨୧˚　˚୨୧⋆｡˚ ⋆\nBonus Information:\n\nOshi’s around the net usually put an intro (its like a “carrd”) on their SNS’s where you’ll get to know more about them! They usually have these symbols to indicate what’s OK and not OK!\n◎ – Very OK, Approves\n○ – OK, Supports, Yes\n△ – Partially OK (between ○ and X)\nX – Absolutely not allowed, Prohibited\n\nI hope this was helpful!\nThank you so much for reading! \n⋆ ˚｡⋆୨୧˚　˚୨୧⋆｡˚ ⋆\n\nShare this:\n\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\n\nX\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\nFacebook\n\nLike\n \nLoading...\n\nRelated\n\n \n\nShare this:\n\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\n\nX\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\nFacebook\n\nLike\n \nLoading...\n \n\n One thought on “\nOshi Terms 101 : A Guide\n”\n\nI am currently learning japanese by myself and I’ve just found this blog in a desperate try to interact more with JP fandoms🥺🥺🥺 All of this info was very useful, thank you so much😭😭😭❤️\n\nLike\nLike\n\nReply\n \n\nLeave a comment \nCancel reply\n \n\nArchives\n\nAugust 2020\n (5)\n\nMay 2020\n (1)\n\nFollow Yumemipi's Outlet ♥ on WordPress.com\n\n \n\n \nComment \n\nReblog\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribed\n\n Yumemipi's Outlet ♥ \n\n Already have a WordPress.com account? \nLog in now.\n \n\n \n\n Yumemipi's Outlet ♥ \n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribed\n\nSign up\n\nLog in\n\nCopy shortlink\n\n Report this content \n\n View post in Reader \n\nManage subscriptions\n\nCollapse this bar\n\n \n\nLoading Comments...\n\n \n\n%d\n\n \n\n \nDesign a site like this with WordPress.com\nGet started", "language": "lang_en", "country": "us"}

That’d be incredibly inappropriate for me to do, as I don’t know any of them well enough to know if they are a part of the jirai kei subculture. I am simply listing vtubers who seem to be the most popular within the ryousanjirai crowd, that is those whose female fanbase seems to have a higher proportion of ryousanjirai girls than most. \nThe other thing I’d like to get out of the way is that some vtubers on this list are known for using “menhera” as an insult. Sadly, thats grown popular in the vtuber scene and online spaces in japan. For vtuber fans reading this who think that’s a weird thing to say, the word “menhera” has been around since 2001 and was the name given to an internet subculture revolving around mental health safe spaces, awareness, and vent art. Even tho it was literally created to help erase the “mental illness makes you dangerous” thing, the stigma took over once the term went mainstream, so its often used to mean “yandere psycho”. The subculture still exists if you know where to look, but barely ever uses the name it gave itself anymore because it attracts trolls, edgelords, and fetishists.\nOne last thing- a few of these girls fit the “loli” archetype, and consider it a part of their appeal, but no minors will be featured on this list.\nabsolutely zero past-life discussion\nI’ll do my best to summarize what the vtuber is known for and the reasons i think are likely why their female fanbase has a larger proportion of ryousanjirai girls. \n1. Sakamata Chloe (Hololive HoloX)\nGiven that she recently got a new outfit that looks a lot like a dark girly kei coord, you’ve probably seen Chloe on your feed recently. Despite her yamikawaii punk-ish look, she’s so cute and probably couldn’t survive in the wild if she were a real orca. The “pon” is unreal. Her original songs talk about her own inner pain in a way that may be relatable to jirai girls, and she’s covered a lot of songs popular with us too (such as Cute Loving and Devil Janai Mon). Between her cutesiness, choice in fashion, and her songs, it’s easy to see why she’s loved by jirai kei girls.\n2. Minato Aqua (Hololive Gen. 2)\nYou probably know about Aqua if you follow me, since I just posted a link to one of her more recent song covers. It’s one about a ryousangata girl falling in love with a host, and knowing his affection is fake but wanting it anyway. She covers a lot of songs about topics that are familiar to ryousan and jirai girls, like kyuukurarin, darling dance, goodbye declaration, and internet overdose to name a few. Her original songs are also hits with the ryousangata crowd, with “aqua iro palette” being the choice of song in so many tiktoks and reels of ryousan wotas showing off their lavish birthday celebrations for their oshis. She’s also a cosplayer, frequently wearing maid outfits, making her relatable to a lot of girls who work at concept cafes. She also did a duet with Shion, a cover of “menhera janai mon”, which is a song i often see misinterpreted outside of japan because of the need for cultural context on jirai kei, ryousangata, and menhera both as a subculture and insult. Should I do a post explaining the lyrics and overall themes? \n3. Makaino Ririmu (Nijisanji Gamers Generation 3)\nListen. If you’re in the jirai kei subculture, I guarantee you’ve seen Ririmu. This girl’s fanart is probably on every jirai kei blog known to man. If you don’t recognize this model, you’d recognize the maid outfit with bondage elements thats paired with a coat that looks suspiciously like REFLEM’s bunny ears coat (the one that took yamikawa lovers by storm a while back). Ririmu’s popularity with jirai kei girls isn’t just because she likes similar fashions to most of us. Ririmu has been open about her past suffering with agorophobia, suicidal ideation, and being a NEET. She’s shared bits and pieces of her recovery with her fans! Of course, she also does yandere bit that might be more than a bit, and covers a lot of songs popular with ryousan and jirai girls, like more kyun, chuupuri, and vampire.\n4. Mikeneko (Indie)\nMikeneko isn’t new to the scene at all, but has recently come out of a partly mental health related hiatus to a much larger following than before. Mikeneko collects models like they’re pokemon cards, going thru four in total now, two of which have been in one year. She wears tons of yamikawa fashions, and plays up her chuunibyou for streams. Aside from her on-and-off NEETdom, Mikeneko is open about a lot of her health issues, including bipolar, and about her medication and trips to the psychiatric hospital. She calls herself menhera, often in the secondary meaning, but she’s also rumored to have been a part of the actual subculture for a long time. Her original songs, drop and you&me ring really true for a lot of jirai and menhera girls such as myself.\n5. Meloco Kyoran (Nijisanji EN Generation 7)\nMeloco is the only vtuber on this list to be a part of an company’s EN (english-speaking) branch. She’s included on the list because she’s also big in japan- because she’s japanese. She’s almost fluent in english and was accepted for the english branch, but frequently slips into japanese and appeals to her japanese fans. Her outfit is gothic lolita inspired with bondage elements and plenty of edge, to fit her overall spooky exorcist theming. Her creepy-cute nature and cool alternative onee-san demeanor have attracted her many jirai kei fans, and inspired a lot of ryousan girls’ oshi nails.\n6. Sukoya Kana (Nijisanji Tulip-gumi Unit)\nAdmittedly, Kana’s probably got more menhera (as in the subculture) fans than jirai or ryousan, but she still has enough that I wanted to include her. Her nurse theming isn’t just a gimmick, her actual “day job” is as a nurse. As in, when she’s not streaming, she works in a hospital as staff after passing her qualifying exams in 2022! She must be super busy! Her morbid interests and fetishes, as well as her medical themed design, have no doubt appealed to many jirai girls too. Besides that, she’s covered a lot of songs, including quite a few beloved by landmines such as lavie, nainai girls pride, and godish.\n7. Natori Sana (Indie)\nListen, I just know you’ve seen her figures by now. Every menhera, yamikawaii, and “cutecore” account in the west has at least one of this nurse girl’s figures. She’s ultra cute, with a sickeningly sweet smile and design. Her lore is interesting- she claims to work at a sanitarium, but has hinted very heavily many times that she is in fact not a nurse, but a patient in denial. Whether this is just lore for fun and appeal or is a dramatized reflection of Sana’s own feelings and mental health is up for speculation.\n8. La+ (Laplus) Darkness (HoloX)\nRemember that disclaimer regarding using menhera derogatorily earlier? Yeah that’s 90% because of Laplus’s inclusion on the list. It feels like she accuses someone of being menhera (derogatory) like every other VOD. Apart from that, Laplus is a grade A kusogaki, complete with constant angry outburst when things don’t go her way. She’s a demon whos intelligence was… “sealed away”… sure. Her gothic appearance and explosive personality seem to be what’s gained her such a large jirai kei following.\n9. Houshou Marine (Hololive Gen. 3)\nDear god. Alright, so you’ve definitely heard at least two of her songs if you’re on japanese jirai kei SNS at all. This cosplaying pirate is so horny that it’s literally considered her catchphrase. Her original songs about wanting to be seen as desirable and be… pleasured seem to be especially popular with landmine girls (which is maybe related to how many jirai girls are in a certain profession). She enjoys gothic lolita fashion, girls love/yuri, and enough fetishes to lose track of if you’re counting. \n10. Shigure Ui (Indie)\nDid you really think I could make this list without including hololive star Oozora Subaru’s mom and voice of the song that’s plaguing japanese social media, ESPECIALLY landmine social media rn? Sure, it’s everywhere, but go check every insta kaiwai dedicated to jirai subculture and see how many of their reels have this song. Even though she’s just now broken out to this degree of fame, she’s been around a while, and is the “mama” (artist) to several other vtubers. She often collabs with hololive members! She loves taboo fiction, which is also especially popular amongst jirai girls.\nLast but not least, I want to add three honorable mentions from Hololive that are also popular with ryousanjirai girls. Tokoyami Towa is a super popular choice of cosplay amongst jirai girls specifically. She has a cute-but-cool look, and lots of her outfits definitely have subcultural influences from japanese ゴスパンク (gothic x punk) and general “egirl”-type styles. Murasaki Shion is a very popular choice of profile pic for ryousanjirai girls, and it’s easy to see why. Her “kusogaki” appeal and lolita outfits, as well as her “Menhera Janai Mon” duet with Aqua all appeal to that demographic. Finally, last honorable mention is Amane Kanata, purely because of how popular she is with lovers of Tenshi Kaiwai, which has a lot of overlap with the jirai subculture. She basically predicted the trend before the magazine that popularized it even existed. Mizuiro x white cybercore outfits, a nurse cosplay, and angel theming make her a spot-on icon in that scene.\nThat’s it! Now I have to stop procrastinating on the pien kei characters post…\n\n \n\n \n \n64 notes\n\nalternativelis\n liked this \ngivemeyourfaceplzzz\n liked this \nfeargardenz\n liked this \nporcelanitaa\n liked this \nbonehalos\n liked this \ndigital-angelz\n liked this \np1nkmedusa\n liked this \nhimenako\n liked this \nzitds\n liked this \njiraiyui\n liked this \n3xistent14lcrisis\n liked this \ncarrotflowerboy\n liked this \ncandyebun\n liked this \nditzypudding\n liked this \ndinight866\n reblogged this from \npienhime\n \nkeyqu1455\n liked this \noracleofdykey\n liked this \novertnihilist\n liked this \nsemisweet-heart\n reblogged this from \npienhime\n \nsemisweet-heart\n liked this \nrosenlita\n liked this \npoorpastel-pain\n liked this \ncottoncandydreamsandlace\n liked this \ntetsudouprincess\n liked this \npersocons\n liked this \njirai-girl\n liked this \nddrexpert\n liked this \narsonistman\n liked this \nchacharcherry\n liked this \ntorashii-tk\n liked this \npastel-mo0n\n liked this \ngonathanwithag\n liked this \nmari-wa-landmine\n liked this \nyustandforrain\n liked this \nwriting-bella\n liked this \ndoll-lesbian\n liked this \nkanon-byrnhildr\n liked this \npixistix-and-poprox\n liked this \nchesheyer\n liked this \npienhime\n posted this \n\n Two important things to know before you read any further: I am NOT alleging any of these vtubers to be jirai kei.

Pastel medical accessories like syringes, pins with nooses + pills and vent art on oversized clothing on full display.\nA series of satire comics by Bisuko Ezaki titled \"Wrist cut warrior Menherachan/メンヘラチャン\" that originally started off as vent art became popularized through Yami Kawaii as well.\nThe character has now become a staple in the fashion.

Statements consisting only of original research should be removed.\n \n(\nJanuary 2025\n)\n (\nLearn how and when to remove this message\n)\n\nJapanese street fashion\n refers to a number of styles of contemporary modern clothing in \nJapan\n. Created from a mix of both local and foreign fashion brands, Japanese \nstreet fashions\n tend to have their own distinctive style, with some considered to be extreme and \nimaginative\n, with similarities to the \nhaute couture\n styles seen on European \ncatwalks\n.\n\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\n\nAs early as the 1950s, there were a few brands specially catered to street fashion, such as \nOnitsuka Tiger\n (now known as \nASICS\n).\n\nIn addition, the emergence of strong youth culture in the 1960s and 1970s that continues today (especially in \nHarajuku\n, a district in Shibuya, Tokyo) drives much of the development of new styles, looks, and fashion subcultures. The rise of \nconsumerism\n, which played an important part in Japan's \"national character\" during its economic boom in the 1980s, continues to influence fashion purchases, even after this economic bubble burst in the 1990s. These factors result in the swift turnover and variability in styles popular at any one time.\n[\n1\n]\n\nIn 2003, \nJapanese hip-hop\n, which had long been present among underground Tokyo's club scene, influenced the mainstream fashion industry.\n[\n2\n]\n The popularity of the music was so influential that Tokyo's youth imitated their favorite hip hop stars from the way they dress with oversized clothes to tanned skin.\n[\n3\n]\n\nThough extremely popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, many trends experienced a levelling off in the later 2000s and onwards; the rise and fall of many of these trends had been chronicled by \nShoichi Aoki\n since 1997 in the fashion magazine \nFruits\n, which was a notable magazine for the promotion of street fashion in Japan.\n[\n4\n]\n\nFashion industry and popular brands\n[\nedit\n]\n\nComme des Garçons garments on display at the \nMetropolitan Museum of Art\n\nAlthough Japanese street fashion is known for its mix-match of different styles and genres, and there is no single sought-after brand that can consistently appeal to all fashion groups, the huge demand created by the fashion-conscious population is fed and supported by Japan's vibrant fashion industry. \nIssey Miyake\n, \nYohji Yamamoto\n and \nComme des Garçons\n are often said to be the three cornerstone brands of Japanese fashion. Together they were particularly recognized as a Japanese fashion force in the early 1980s for their intensive use of \nmonochrome\n color and cutting-edge design.\n\nThe social motives driving interaction with and involvement in personal fashion choices and wider fashion movements within Japan are complex. Firstly, the comparatively large quantity of disposable income available to Japanese youth is significant; many argue this has been, historically, made possible through a greater degree of Japanese youth living at home with their parents for much longer than in other countries, reducing living expenses and thus making larger spending on clothing possible.\n[\n5\n]\n\nJapan is also known for its significant consumption of foreign luxury brands. According to data from 2006, Japan consumed 41 percent of the entire world's \nluxury goods\n.\n[\n6\n]\n The blue line of \nBurberry\n is among the most successful in this arena.\n\nJapanese street fashion influences the \nWest Coast of the United States\n.\n[\n7\n]\n High-end fashion brands like \nComme des Garçons\n have played a big role in the global industry since the 1980s, especially through frequent cross-over guest design with other brands. In 2008, \nRei Kawakubo\n designed for \nLouis Vuitton\n[\n8\n]\n and \nH&M\n.\n[\n9\n]\n Harajuku Fashion was ranked 5th in the fashion field of Google Search of the Year in 2019.\n[\n10\n]\n\nModern Japanese street fashion\n[\nedit\n]\n\nThough the styles have changed over the years, street fashion is still prominent in \nTokyo\n today. Young adults can often be found wearing subculture attire in large urban fashion districts such as \nHarajuku\n (\nUra-Harajuku\n), \nAoyama\n, \nGinza\n, \nOdaiba\n, \nShinjuku\n and \nShibuya\n.\n\nLolita\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nLolita fashion\n\nSweet Lolita (left) and Gothic Lolita (right)\n\nContaining many different themes within its boundaries, Lolita has become one of the larger, more recognizable styles in Japanese street fashion and has gained a following worldwide. Skirts or dresses are usually worn at or below knee length with petticoats beneath for volume. Blouses or tops are lace-trimmed or ruffled in the Victorian or Rococo style. The length of the socks or stockings can go from ankle to thigh level and may be topped with lace. Wearers of this fashion style often put on \nMary Janes\n, tea party shoes, or boots. The more well-known sub-styles within Lolita fashion are as follows:\n\nGothic Lolita - Lolita with a heavy influence from the Eastern and Victorian Goth style. Often characterized by dark colors and accessories adorned with motifs such as skeletons, bats, spiders, and other popular gothic 'icons', such as characters from \nTim Burton\n films. Victorian iron gates and architectural designs are also often seen in dress prints. Bonnets, rectangle headdresses, and brooches are popular accessories for Gothic Lolita.\n\nSweet Lolita - the most childlike style, mostly characterized by baby animals, fairy tale themes, and innocent, childlike attire. It was originally inspired by Victorian children's clothing and the \nkawaii\n culture that is very prevalent in Japan. Pastel colors are often used, although some dresses or skirts may feature darker or muted colors as well. Large head bows, cute purses, and stuffed animals are popular accessories for Sweet Lolita.\n\nClassic Lolita - a sub-style more closely resembling the historical fashion of the Rococo or Victorian eras. The colors that are used in this look are usually muted, thus giving this sub-style a more mature feel. Floral prints and solid colors are common, although fancier prints are not unheard of as well. Small head bows, bonnets, rectangle headdresses, and hair corsages are popular accessories for Classic Lolita.\n\nPunk Lolita - an experimental style, mixing the influences of Punk with Lolita. It can sometimes look deconstructed or crazy while keeping most of the 'Lolita silhouette'.\n\nOuji - also known as 'boy style', are the more masculine counterparts of lolita, influenced by Victorian boys' clothing. 'Prince pants', which are short capri-style pants that are cut off the knee, usually with some sort of detail (such as lace-edged cuffs) are commonly worn with masculine blouses, top hats, knee socks, and other accessories.\n[\n11\n]\n\nGyaru\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nGyaru\n\nGyaru\n being photographed in \nIkebukuro\n in 2009\n\nGyaru\n (sometimes known as \nGanguro\n, actually a subcategory of \ngyaru\n), is a type of Japanese street fashion that originated in the 1970s. \nGyaru\n focuses on girly-glam style, dwelling on man-made beauty, such as wigs, fake lashes, and fake nails. \nGyaru\n is also heavily inspired by Western fashion.\n\nGanguro\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nGanguro\n\nTwo \nganguro\n girls in Tokyo, April 2008\n\nThe \nGanguro\n style of Japanese street fashion became popular among Japanese girls in the early 1990s and peaked in the early 2000s. \nGanguro\n falls into the larger subculture of \ngyaru\n fashion. \nGanguro\n typically includes brightly colored outfits, mini-skirts, and tie-dyed \nsarongs\n. The \nganguro\n style consists of bleached hair, a deep tan, fake eyelashes, black and white eyeliner, bracelets, earrings, rings, necklaces, and platform shoes.\n\nMany people consider \nNamie Amuro\n to have been the leading figure of \nganguro\n style. Exactly after her public appearances with tanned skin and dyed hair, a lot of Japanese girls started to follow her example. The terms \n\"Yamanba\"\n and \n\"Manba\"\n refer to the extreme ends of the \nGanguro\n style. However, enthusiasts of both the \nYamanba\n and \nManba\n styles consider \nganguro\n as an \"easy version\" of their style. Nowadays, the name \n'Yamanba'\n has shortened to \n'Manba'\n. \n\n[\n12\n]\n\nKogal\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nKogal\n\nA \nkogal\n identified by her \nloose socks\n and shortened skirt\n\nThe \nKogal\n (\nKogyaru\n) look is based on a high school uniform, but with a shorter skirt, \nloose socks\n, and often dyed hair and scarf as well. Members of the \nKogal\n style sometimes refer to themselves as \nGyaru\n (gals). This style was prominent in the 1990s, and it started gaining popularity again at the end of 2020, however it is an age category specifically for gals in high school.\n\nBōsōzoku\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nBōsōzoku\n\nJapanese \ncosplayers\n dressed up in \nbōsōzoku\n-style outfits\n\nWhile \nbōsōzoku\n fashion has not been widely popular since the 1990s, the stereotypical \nBōsōzoku\n look is often portrayed, and even caricatured, in many forms of Japanese media such as anime, manga, and films. The typical \nbōsōzoku\n member is often depicted in a uniform consisting of a \njumpsuit\n like those worn by manual laborers or a \ntokko-fuku\n (\n特攻服\n)\n, a type of military issued over-coat with \nkanji\n slogans. These are usually worn open, with no shirt underneath, showing off bandaged torsos and matching baggy pants tucked inside tall boots.\n\nAmekaji\n[\nedit\n]\n\nAmekaji is a style based on American casual, often narrowly defined as Western/Native American/Biker-based. Amekaji was introduced to the public in the early 1990s by a group of delinquents in \nShibuya\n known as \"Teamer\". Later, it was popularized by \nTakuya Kimura\n who wore it in his TV dramas.\n\nDecora Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nExample of Decora fashion\n\nThe \nDecora Kei\n style originated in the late 1990s/early 2000s and rose to great popularity both in and outside Japan. It is exemplified by singer \nKyary Pamyu Pamyu\n, who rose to prominence in the \nHarajuku\n fashion scene before her musical debut. The wearers usually stick to a color scheme for their decora, such as Pink Decora, Red Decora, Dark Decora, and Rainbow Decora. A plain shirt and hoodie were often worn with short \ntutu\n-like skirts. The hair (often worn in low ponytails with long bangs) and make-up itself tend to be quite plain. However, the most significant part of \nDecora Kei\n is to pile on many layers of cute accessories until the bangs and front hair is barely visible. Stockings, legwarmers, arm warmers, and knee socks are also worn over each other in different layers. Common details also include \nleopard prints\n and patterned \ndental masks\n. The style has since decreased in popularity but still has a large following worldwide.\n\nVisual \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nVisual Kei\n\nVisual \nkei\n band \nVersailles\n\nVisual \nKei\n is a subculture created in the mid-1980s by Japanese musicians consisting of striking makeup, unusual hair styles, and flamboyant costumes, similar to Western \nglam rock\n and \nglam metal\n. \nAndrogyny\n is also a popular aspect of the style. Some of the more well-known and influential artists of the style include \nX Japan\n, \nLuna Sea\n, \nVersailles\n, \nThe Gazette\n, \nMejibray\n, \nRoyz\n, \nL'Arc-en-Ciel\n, \nAn Cafe\n, \nMalice Mizer\n, and \nDiaura\n.\n\nOshare Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nOshare Kei\n is the opposite side of Visual \nKei\n, with bright colors and many pop impressions. This said, bands under this style live up to the meaning by dressing up in colorful costumes, or in \nDecora\n or \nPop Kei\n style; many are seen sporting large amounts of jewelry and bags of anime characters and animals slung on, many colorful hairclips, and lighter make-up. The music is more happy sounding, the lyrics lighter and happier. Bands include \nAn Cafe\n, \nPanic Channel\n, Ichigo69, Lolita23q, \nSug\n, Delacroix, \nLM.C\n, and Aicle.\n[\n13\n]\n\nAngura Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nAngura Kei\n is a dark Japanese fashion that is often associated with a subgenre of \nVisual Kei\n. The term derives from the Japanese pronunciation of \"underground\", which refers to its origins in underground theater. The clothes tend to be heavily influenced by traditional Japanese elements as well as the \nShowa era\n (1926–1989) but with a Goth spin to it. The make-up usually consists of \nshironuri\n and is dark and heavy. While kimono is the most commonly used by visual \nkei\n artists, the style also often features modified Japanese school uniforms. Motifs and accessories are themed around post-war Japan and the occult.\n\nCult Party \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nCult Party \nKei\n, named after the Harajuku shop \nCult Party\n (now known as the \nVirgin Mary\n), is a style that was popular around the early 2010s and is based on Western religious artifacts like crosses or bibles. Common aspects include crosses wired in yarn, layers of fabric in soft colors, lots of cream lace and satin bows. The make-up and hairstyle is not as over the top as other styles. Cult Party \nKei\n is often worn with natural-looking make-up without any larger emphasis on the eyes and simple hair-dos with roses. Cult Party \nKei\n is considered by some to be a subset of Dolly \nKei\n.\n\nDolly \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nDolly \nKei\n is a style based on Japan's view of the \nMiddle Ages\n and European \nfairy tales\n, especially the \nBrothers Grimm\n and \nHans Christian Andersen\n. It includes a lot of vintage-style clothing and sometimes has religious symbols. \nGrimoire\n is a store in Japan that has been described as \"the pioneering store behind the Dolly-\nkei\n fashion scene\".\n[\n14\n]\n\nFairy \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nFairy \nKei\n is a youthful style based on 1980s fashion that evokes a dreamy, nostalgic feeling. Outfits are made up of pastel colors, angels, toys and generally cute motifs and elements and accessories from Western toy lines of the 1980s and early 1990s, such as \nPolly Pocket\n, \nMy Little Pony\n, \nStrawberry Shortcake\n, \nRainbow Brite\n, \nPopples\n, \nLady Lovely Locks\n, \nBarbie\n, \nWuzzles\n, and \nCare Bears\n. Pastel-colored hair is common, although natural hair is also popular, and hairstyles are usually kept simple and decorated with anything cute or pastel; bows are a common theme. Some common items used in a Fairy Kei coordinate include vintage sweaters, cardigans, varsity jackets, tutus, mini skirts, tights, over-the-knee socks, sneakers, and tea party shoes. The term \"Fairy \nKei\n\" originated from the magazine called \nZipper\n (despite a common belief that Sayuri Tabuchi [Tavuchi], the owner of Tokyo fashion store \nSpank!\n, was the accidental creator of the style).\n[\n15\n]\n\nGirly \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nGirly \nKei\n is a hyperfeminine Japanese fashion style that emphasizes cute and girlish appearance. As opposed to the definition in English, Girly Kei does not generally only consider everything feminine and mature looks; Girly Kei tends to focus on lace, ribbons, ruffles, and patterns such as flowers and hearts, with soft and pastel colors such as pink being the main focus. There are many substyles and the popular image can vary depending on the current trends has pushed Girly Kei's evolution into a more hyper-feminine and innocent direction during the early 2020s because mainstream fashion trends took heavily from this style.\n\nMori Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMori Kei\n (\nmori\n meaning \"forest\") uses soft, loosely fitting layers of garments such as floaty dresses and cardigans. It places an emphasis on natural fabrics (\ncotton\n, \nlinen\n, \nwool\n) and hand-made or vintage accessories with a nature theme. The color scheme tends to be light and neutral, but patterns such as gingham and florals may also be used. In terms of hairstyles, bangs (often curled) and braids are very popular. The style is similar to Dolly \nKei\n in that the aim is to create a doll-like appearance but in a more casual, earthy manner.\n[\n16\n]\n\nJirai Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nA \nHatsune Miku\n cosplayer wearing Jirai Kei\n\nJirai Kei is the edgier counterpart to the aforementioned Girly Kei fashion style. Jirai Kei, literally meaning \"landmine type\", is a fashion subculture originating from Japan's \nKabukichō\n and spread in popularity in the early 2020s, which incorporates \ndark\n and \nkawaii\n styles. Described as similar to \nLolita\n and \nPreppy\n fashions in clothing, it's often paired with accessories with bow, heart, \ncross\n, and lace elements, and wear \nplatform shoes\n. The primary colors in Jirai Kei are black, white, and pale pink. It highlights femininity, cuteness, and fosters a sense of loveliness with the perfect balance of cool. The stereotype behind this subculture is that cute, hyper-feminine young women who dress in darker fashion styles have personalities that do not match their appearance. Rather than being sweet and kind, they are said to be violent and obsessive.\n[\n17\n]\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n\nGirly fashion has a wide range of different clothing types, like Girly Kei, Jirai Kei fashion has been met by widespread social prejudice, directed towards those who wear Jirai Kei and their lifestyle choices not just about being what western society thinks of as feminine. It highlights lace, ribbons, ruffles, and playful patterns like hearts, with soft pastel pinks as the main focus, perfectly balanced by striking blacks.\n[\n18\n]\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n\nPeeps\n[\nedit\n]\n\nPeeps is a 90s-inspired sporty goth style that has been popularized in Harajuku's underground scene by the online magazine \nPEEPS\n.

So I've come across the term landmine or mine woman when looking through \nwear.jp\n today (I'm a fan of Japanese fashions). It was a tag on someone's outfit, so I clicked it and girly and goth style coords popped up. I also saw the term several weeks ago when looking at Japanese makeup videos (the girl was going a dark girly style of makeup). What exactly does this term mean? When I googled 地雷女 a bunch of dating advice articles popped up saying this is the type of woman to avoid. But it seems like an extreme stereotype and not an actual personality type. Also, girls seem to be labeling themselves/ their style with this term, but I'm not sure if they're doing it unironically or not. Is this term just a joke or is it kind of insulting (like otaku)?\n \n\n Note: I don't know how to read katakana or hiragana, I just use google translate when searching things in Japanese.\n \n\n Read more\n \n \n\n \n\n Archived post.

It is primarily associated with young people frequenting the nightlife of Kabukichō. Initially, the style closely resembled the darker variant of \nJapanese Girly\n fashion during its peak popularity, but it has since evolved to incorporate a wider range of styles.\n\nThe subculture carries a stereotype: young women who adopt this cute, hyperfeminine yet dark fashion are perceived to have personalities that contradict their appearance. Instead of being sweet and demure, they are often stereotyped as violent and obsessive (akin to a \nYandere\n), engaging in self-harm, and having habits of heavy drinking or smoking.\n\nJapanese brands have rapidly adapted to this trend, with Western brands influenced by Kawaii culture also following suit.\n\nContents\n\n1\n \nHistory\n\n2\n \nVisuals\n\n3\n \nFashion\n\n3.1\n \nTops\n\n3.2\n \nBottoms\n\n3.3\n \nShoes and Legwear\n\n3.4\n \nAccessories\n\n3.5\n \nHair and Makeup\n\n4\n \nMedia\n\n4.1\n \nLiterature\n\n4.2\n \nManga\n\n4.3\n \nTelevision\n\n4.4\n \nVideo Games\n\n5\n \nMusic\n\n5.1\n \nSongs\n\n5.2\n \nPlaylists\n\n6\n \nCriticism\n\n7\n \nResources\n\n7.1\n \nBlogs\n\n7.2\n \nVendors\n\n8\n \nGallery\n\n9\n \nReferences\n\n10\n \nNavigation\n\nHistory\n[\n]\n\nThe term \"Jirai Kei\" is derived from \"\nJirai Onna\n\" (地雷女), literally \"landmine woman,\" a derogatory term used to stereotype women, particularly those with mental illnesses such as Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), bipolar disorder, and other mood swing-inducing conditions, as a \"ticking time bomb.\" This term is often employed to dismiss women, frequently ex-girlfriends, as \"crazy\" or \"dangerous\" based on arbitrary traits, such as an affinity for kawaii aesthetics. Within the subculture, women are referred to as \"\nJirai Joshi\n\" (地雷女子), or \"landmine girls,\" while men are called \"\nJirai Danshi\n\" (地雷男子), or \"landmine boys.\"\n\nThe subculture became associated with various darker fashion styles following a \"psycho girlfriend\" dress-up challenge that gained viral traction during the March 2020 COVID-19 restrictions in Japan.\n[\n1\n]\n This challenge frequently referenced traits commonly associated with the Toyoko Kids, a group primarily composed of young runaway teenagers, some of whom were groomed online by older men with promises of a better life in the Kabukicho red-light district. These individuals are often exploited for sex work, drug trafficking, and other criminal activities.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\n\nWhile Western followers of Jirai Kei often attempt to separate it from its darker origins by viewing it solely as a fashion trend, the subculture largely retains a negative public image within Japan. Its associations with the \"psycho girlfriend\" trope are interpreted as a misogynistic stereotype, yet Japanese girls who identify as \"landmine\" fully embrace it.\n[\n4\n]\n This misunderstanding stems from several factors: the language barrier hindering accurate interpretation of Japanese articles and social media posts, a lack of awareness regarding the perception of mental health issues in Japan, and brands capitalizing on the subculture's popularity by using \"Jirai Kei\" as a marketing term, regardless of whether their products are genuinely associated with it.\n\nVisuals\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExample of a heavily edited selfie by @hiudayonn.\n \n \n\nGirls in this subculture add \nheavy filters and edits\n to their photos. Pale pink and white filters can add a slight haze to all of their images, and they are often decorated in \nvirtual stickers\n with Jirai Kei motifs. They also use \nface and body editing\n to the point of an unnatural appearance. Impossibly large eyes with anime proportions, making skin more pale, and making their bodies thinner and longer are extremely common in photos. This is with the goal of appearing eerie and puppy-eyed, diverging from the trend of \"pien\" makeup on Japanese tiktok. The color palettes of Jirai Kei is mainly white, black and pastel pink, though on occasion red, blue and grey is also used. \n\nTo contrast all of the sweet and girly visuals, violent imagery is often shown. \nBox-cutters, razors, and pockets knives\n are commonly featured in outfit posts. The stereotype is that a landmine girl would use it to threaten her boyfriend if he upsets her, or that she engages in self-harm. Additionally, these cute girls often pose with \nfake guns\n (firearms are illegal in Japan), cigarettes, or \nalcohol and energy drinks\n (from Strong Zero and Monster Energy) with straws, presumably to protect their lipstick while drinking. Many photos have color-scheme matching energy drink cans, and it is even popular to stack and glue the cans in the shape of machine guns. Similar to Yami Kawaii, there is often medical imagery of \npills and syringes\n, usually paired with narcotics and synthetic drugs. \n\nSanrio is strongly associated with the \nKawaii\n, girly, and consumer culture in Japan. As a result, girls into Jirai Kei are also associated with these characters, specifically \nKuromi\n and My Melody\n. People in this subculture own and take photos of plushies of these characters and own an assortment of merchandise, such as backpacks, pencil pouches, etc. themed around these characters. Sanrio has taken notice and even released Jirai Kei-inspired plushies of Kuromi and My Melody. Another character that can be associated is Menhera-chan, the suicidal magical girl that popularized \nYami Kawaii\n. Her artist has drawn her in stereotypical outfits, and her self-destructive habits could be relatable for those in the subculture. \n\nThere's also many artists engaging with the subculture who draw \nanime-style illustrations\n of landmine girls wearing the typical outfits while in stereotypical situations, such as taking selfies, holding a can while squatting on the streets, or having a mental breakdown. Jirai Kei followers often repost these \ndrawings on social media\n. \n\nFashion\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe various styles worn by jirai girls illustrated featuring Blue Archive characters. \n \n \n\nThe styles associated with Jirai Kei are constantly changing with the core defining trait being that the fashion is worn by landmine girls. Comparable to \nE-Girl\n’s style, while landmine girls may wear many different fashion styles, there is a main look typically associated with the aesthetic that evolved out of a mix of several different alternative genres. The initial look associated with the Jirai Kei subculture derived from \nJapanese Girly fashion\n and \nYami Kawaii\n, however outfits consisting out of \nGoth Punk\n, \nJersey Maid\n, and darker general \nalternative\n fashion have also been popular among its followers. As the trends within Jirai Kei keep on changing, many brands mimic one another and release mix-and-match variations for the various styles worn. The fabric of the clothes tends to be on the more synthetic side, with the quality not being that high, on account of them often being made by fast fashion companies who constantly adopt to the latest trends. \n\nRegardless of the style worn, the idea is to appear cute yet mature, but with an dark aura. \n\nThe ultra-feminine Jirai style has also evolved since its inception. As the style developed, the details of the style increased, with certain trends being more or less popular as certain garments from specific brands became viral. \n\nTops\n[\n]\n\nThe most common tops are \nblouses with ultra-feminine details\n that may slightly resemble \nLolita Fashion.\n Peter Pan and sailor collars, ruffles, lace trim, puffed sleeves, cold-shoulders, contrasting buttons are some tropes that are featured in the blouses. Alternative outfits use coat-dresses instead, and winter outfits utilize knit sweaters. Girls also often \ntie ribbons or add bow brooches with rhinestone or pearl-accented faux jewels\n at the neck. \n\nSome brands have also released \noversized tees and sweatshirts\n that can fit in with this aesthetic. They often have a print with a stereotypical motif, English text, anime prints, etc. These also contain feminine details, but less often. For example, there may be eyelets for lacing ribbon through, zippers, or detachable Peter Pan collars. This resembles the fashion of the \nYami Kawaii\n aesthetic, and contributes to an edgier and less girly look. Jirai boys add masculine or androgynous elements to this style, while girls like to pair these tops with chunky sneakers and necklaces. \n\nA trend that appeared approximately 2023 is the set-up, which is a two-piece set consisting of a \ntunic-length top with a matching pair of micro-shorts\n, with the aim of it looking like an extra-short dress, with the shorts being for modesty purposes. This top would have the same details as the blouses. \n\nBottoms\n[\n]\n\nHigh waisted mini skirts\n are by far the most popular bottom. The silhouette can be flared, trapezoid or pleated. \nSilver hardware details\n such as heart-shaped belt buckles, eyelets, and zippers add edge to the outfit and contrast the lace and girly details of the blouse. But there are also ruffles, ribbon lacing to resemble a corset, and ruffled suspenders to add girliness. \nShorts\n can also be featured in this aesthetic, as well as \nlonger flowy skirts\n. However, they are both comparatively rare to the mini skirts. Usually the bottoms are black while the top is pink or white, though sometimes this is flipped. \n\nThe more casual \nJersey Maid\n and \nYami Kawaii\n inspired looks can also have \ntrack pants\n like ones from Adidas as a pairing with a track suit jacket or oversized tee or sweatshirt. \n\nShoes and Legwear\n[\n]\n\nBecause the legs are most often exposed in this style, \nlace or fishnet stockings\n are worn, and could be switched or even doubled up with \nruffled or lace ankle socks\n. \n\nThe shoes are most commonly \nplatform loafers or multi-strapped mary janes\n, and most girls buy their shoes from BUBBLES Tokyo, DearMyLove, Liz Lisa and others. The shoes can be \nmore decorated,\n with faux jewels, ribbon laces, rhinestone buckles and silver cross charms. \n\nAccessories\n[\n]\n\nThe most popular bags are \ntotes and mini backpacks\n. Usually, they're pink or black, sometimes adorned with ribbons and bows with plushies or Sanrio figurine keychains attached. The most popular mini backpacks on social media are the studded MCM mini packpack and Melody Maison de Fleur totes. Other girls may instead use bags from \npopular luxury brands\n.\n\nAside from ribbons and bows, there is not much jewelry involved in Jirai Kei. Most styles include only earrings or neckwear like chokers, piercings and necklaces. A popular trend is the Viviene Westwood orb necklace. Because of the color scheme, many girls avoid gold jewelry and opt for silver.\n\nHair and Makeup\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAn illustration of the typical hairstyles by \nAkagumi-chan\n.\n \n \n\nHime-cut bangs,\n which are straight bangs across the forehead with side bangs around chin-length, are extremely popular amongst young women in Japan in general as it is an easy way to archive the illusion of a small face. It fits in with the ultra-feminine style. Because these women are Japanese and around high school age, the \nmost common hair color is black\n, since dyed hair is not allowed in schools. However, some girls add \nhighlights that can be bleached blonde or in different shades of pink.\n\nIn terms of styling, \npigtails\n (also called twin tails), are the majority hairstyle. They can be either low or high, with high pigtails often being \nhalf-up half-down\n. Girls often curl the ends and decorate these twin tails with \nribbons and bows\n, often with the same faux jewels on their brooches. Other \nhair accessories\n such as rectangle headdresses, headbands with faux jewels, and bobby pins with charms are popular too. \n\nFor the eye makeup, the most popular is an exaggerated version of the \"\nnamida bukuro\n\" makeup style where the \ntear bags\n are emphasized to look puffy as if the wearer is about to cry, which is further highlighted with pink undereye blush. The additional effect of appearing sickly is also desired. The \neyeliner is downturned to give a more \"puppy-like\"\n , feminine and sad appearance. \n\nFace and lip makeup are equally pink, with \nblush and sparkly highlighter being high\n on the cheekbones. \nLip makeup has a wide variation\n, with some looks being more matte, some glossy, some sculpted, some even. \n\nMany additional cosmetic products are also used for exaggerated features. \nFake lashes\n are generally popular in Japan, and in Jirai Kei, they are longer and spikier. \nDark circle lenses\n are also popular, and serve to make the eyes look bigger and anime-like. \n\nLong acrylic nails\n are also popular and often feature lace patterns, faux jewels, corset lacing, crosses, as well as stereotypical motifs like the pleading face emoji. \n\nMedia\n[\n]\n\nLiterature\n[\n]\n\nHost Madness\n - Oizumi Rika\n\nKabukicho Moratorium\n - Chiwawa Sasaki\n\nPeople Who Overdose\n - Chiwawa Sasaki\n\nThe Disease of Pien: Consumption and Approval of the SNS Generation\n - Chiwawa Sasaki\n\nManga\n[\n]\n\nAshita, Watashi wa Dareka no Kanojo - Tomorrow, I'll Be Someone's Girlfriend\n\nAndroid wa Jirai-kei no Yume wo Miru - Android Dreams of a Jirai Kei Girl\n\nKiken na Ren'ai - Dangerous Love\n\nKimi ni Aisarete Itakatta - It Hurts To Be Loved By You\n\nJirai Kareshi - My Boyfriend's a Ticking Time Bomb\n\nJirai-kei JK to Onee-chan no Hanashi - The Landmine Girl and Her Sister\n\nJirai Ninja Ruru no Shitsuren - Jirai Ninja Ruru's Heartbreak\n\nKakaKano - Dating the Kind of Girl You Shouldn't Get Involved With\n\nKoi wa Jirai wo Funde kara - A Love That Begins After Stepping On A Mine\n\nMitame Jirai-kei Osananajimi - My Childhood Friend Looks Like A Landmine But Isn't\n\nYamaarashi no Shisha (ヤマアラシのシーシャ)\n\nZenma (銭麻)\n\nTelevision\n[\n]\n\nAshita, Watashi wa Dareka no Kanojo\n\nCinderella Complex\n\nIshiko and Haneo: You're Suing Me?\n (episode 7)\n\nThe Black Swindler (episode 8)\n\nVideo Games\n[\n]\n\nJIRAIYA\n\nNeedy Streamer Overload\n\nSentimental Deathloop\n\nSuteki na Kanojo no Tsukurikata\n\nYandere ura Kano Jirai-chan\n\nYamikore\n\nLove Angel Syndrome\n\nMusic\n[\n]\n\nSongs\n[\n]\n\nAlice*Iris - Daikirai Lie Suki\n\nAlice*Iris - Gimme Me Love\n\nAmu - Pien Syndrome\n\nAmu - Mekka Warning\n\nCagayake - Unleash\n\nChilldspot - Ai Ai\n\nDECO*27 - The Vampire\n\nIsana - Menhera Janai Mon!\n\nHoneyWorks - Kawaikute Gomen\n\nKuraisekai - So Pien My Life\n\nKAFU - Egonomy\n\nKai - Unicorn Girl\n\nKai - Lose the Princess\n\nKairiki Bear - Darling Dance\n\nKareki Kashiwagi - Ikayaki-Wristed Girl\n\nLiLiPi - Shukipi Overdose\n\nMagnetite Hiiragi feat.

There are strong associations with mental illness, self harm, drug usage, sex work, underage prostitution, and other uncomfortable subjects. The negative aspects of the \"landmine\" stereotype are often emulated and romanticized as a quirky gimmick solely for aesthetic reasons.\n[\n5\n]\n On Twitter in particular, it's not uncommon for followers of the subculture to constantly promote self-destructive behaviour, the accounts often being part of \nshtwt\n (self-harm twitter) and \nedtwt\n (eating disorder twitter).\n[\n4\n]\n There's also a strong association with \"bangya\" culture with landmine girls also being stereotyped as groupies who are obsessive over their favorite bands and music artists to an unhealthy degree.\n\nAnother problem is the fetishization of the \"landmine\" stereotype, which is a glimpse into the wider topic of sexualizing women who exhibit mental illness. It is problematic for its ableist rhetoric claiming mentally-ill women to be \"freaky\", \"hot but crazy\" and more desirable sexually and emotionally, as well as its infantalistic undertone of these women being more emotionally attached and dependent on their lover's affection.\n[\n6\n]\n This fetishization of mentally ill women and use of the femme-fatale archetype ignores the unpleasant nuances of suffering from BPD or bipolar disorder and targets women who are mentally vulnerable to emotionally abusive, power-imbalanced relationships.\n[\n7\n]\n\nThere also have been issues caused by the strong associations with the host culture of Kabukicho. As people of any age can enter those establishments as long as no alcohol is served, male hosts have been actively going for young girls to spend money on them in exchange for affection, often resulting in the girls resorting to \"papa katsu\" (sugar-daddying) in order to afford their host club addiction.\n[\n8\n]\n\nBecause the clothes worn are often very brand specific, some Jirai Kei netizens suggest that there is slight elitism in the community for purchasing items from the \"correct\" stores, regardless of if the price can be prohibitively expensive, particularly for western followers that endure high shipping fees from Japanese brand proxies. On social media, especially on TikTok, some argue that this brand-focused side of Jirai Kei encourages hyper consumerism and trend-cycling while the same is also said for those who buy cheap replica items from problematic fast fashion stores like Shein/Romwe. \n\nAs the subculture can't be separated from its problematic parts precisely because they are what make Jirai Kei what it is, many have argued that its name shouldn't be used in a throwaway manner in reference to styles or trends in order to not expose strangers to potential triggering content. \n\nResources\n[\n]\n\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\nFor further reading, please read its \npage\n on the Jfashion Wiki. \n\nBlogs\n[\n]\n\nZirai Bijyo\n\nSubcul Zirai\n\nZirai Zyoshi\n\nVendors\n[\n]\n\nAnk Rouge\n\nAmilige\n\nBubbles\n\nDarrdy\n\nDearMyLove\n\nLafary\n\nLIZ LISA\n\nMA*RS\n\nNoemie\n\nReflem\n\nRojita\n\nSubcul Zirai\n\nTravas Tokyo\n\nViviene Westwood\n\nYosuke USA\n\nGallery\n[\n]\n\nキャンメイク縛り地雷メイク【イエベ・茶髪OK】\nA makeup tutorial\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n↑\n \nAbsolutely the largest eyes!!

As \"landmine\" is almost always used in negative context towards a person and to harass or demean, there has been controversy surrounding the name.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\n While the term has seen some use in Japanese media as a sales point, it is still seen as derogatory to the degree that the staff of various companies refuse to work on anything related to the term or trend.\n[\n6\n]\n\nWomen within the subculture are called \"Jirai Joshi\" (地雷女子), or landmine girls, while men in the subculture are referred to as \"Jirai Danshi\" (地雷男子), or landmine boys.\n\nOrigins and Controversy\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nDue to a makeup challenge by Japanese YouTuber SuReRo\n[\n7\n]\n that went viral during the March 2020 corona restrictions in Japan, which was about emulating the \"landmine woman\" stereotype, the term has been associated with various darker styles, gradually morphing into its own subculture.\n[\n8\n]\n\nJirai Kei has strong associations with some darker or disturbing themes, though not in the style on its own like \nYami Kawaii\n. In this case, Jirai Kei may be associated with self-harm, drug abuse, alcoholism, street partying, illegal sex work, and other rebellious and shocking behaviors. The associations of this kind of behavior with Jirai Kei is said to have its roots among the Toyoko Kids - a criminal gang mainly consisting out of teenage runaways that is active in Kabukicho, furthering its negative connotations.\n[\n9\n]\n Many criticize that Jirai Kei has contributed to harmful real life consequences, such as teens and young adults being groomed into self-destructive behavior in order to get accepted within the subculture.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\n\nThere's also arguments to be made for the supposed appropriation of the \"landmine\" stereotype by both Japanese and overseas followers of Jirai Kei as solely a fashion trend. Elements commonly associated with the stereotype are often emulated and romanticized as a quirky gimmick solely for aesthetic reasons.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n13\n]\n Meanwhile, those who engage in substance usage, self-harm, and sex work face criticism and demonization from others into Jirai Kei, especially overseas netizens, who wish to renounce them after accusations of Jirai Kei promoting problematic behavior by outsiders.\n[\n14\n]\n In response, some contend that Jirai Kei followers who engage in problematic behavior, labeled as \"lifestyle landmines\", are the true originators of the subculture and therefore should not be disowned from the community solely for the sake of maintaining the reputation of those who insist on only participating in the associated aesthetics of the subculture, labeled as \"fashion landmines\".\n\nDue to the controversies related to the Jirai Kei subculture, people both within Japan as well overseas have stated that it should be no longer promoted in reference to styles and trends as its the fashion part is already mostly encompassed in \nDark Girly\n and \nYami Kawaii.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n15\n]\n\nStyle Basics\n[\n]\n\nJirai Kei as a style has a strong focus on the overall styling rather than the clothes on their own, and therefore the fashions worn can vary to a high degree depending on the current common trends within the subculture.\n\nClothes\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStyles commonly worn by Jirai girls over the years.\n \n \nSince the initial boom in 2020, Jirai Kei has expanded into multiple directions and now covers a wide range of styles. The classic Jirai Kei outfit features \nGirly\n fashion and emphasizes a feminine yet mysterious aura with a focus on the color combination of black with muted pink, but occasionally also red or white.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n16\n]\n High collared blouses are being worn with a frilly high waist skirt and the clothes are often accented with lace and frills.\n[\n1\n]\n An alternative winter version of the style swaps the frilly blouse with a lacey sweater. Gemstone jewelry often includes rhinestones and pearls. Some of the most popular platform shoe choices are platform loafers and, more commonly, Mary Jane platform clogs (both are usually chosen from around 3 inches to 5 inches of back heel length). Lace trim socks or dark tights are be worn under the shoes.\n\nAs the initial look associated with Jirai Kei became mainstream, it started to move on to edgier alternative fashion looks.\n[\n3\n]\n The outfits of this type are generally unisex and often incorporate oversized \nYami Kawaii\n tops with their typical prints, the most popular being depictions of sick or injured stuffed animals, that are worn like a dress and reach a little below the thigh area. There's also many \nGoth Punk\n elements with ripped sweaters, bondage elements, fishnet tights, and massive platform shoes.\n[\n17\n]\n Tracksuits are also occasionally worn in combination with leg warmers or loose socks. Black is still in the central focus for the clothes but with vibrant colors such as red, blue, or purple, as accents. \n\nHair and Makeup\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nTypical \"namida bukuro\" makeup.\n \n \n\nJirai Kei makeup often resembles a highly exaggerated version of byojaku makeup with the typical pink or red under eye blush, emphasized tear bags, down-turned black eyeliner, and overall pale makeup foundation. Black circle lens contacts are commonly worn to make the eyes appear bigger, lipstick colors can vary based on how the wearer decides.\n[\n1\n]\n\nFor hairstyles, hime cut bangs, twin-tails with the ends curled (also referred to as pigtails), and black hair with highlights are most common, though many Japanese Jirai girls also dye strands of their hair to a darker pink color, or use colored extensions. Cute nail art (black and white being the most common colors) with gems and 3D art are also usually seen, especially incorporating Sanrio themes.\n\nAccessories\n[\n]\n\nCommon accessories in Jirai Kei include long black satin hair bows, Miu Miu bracelets, variants of the saturn logo necklace from Vivienne Westwood, a Jill Stuart handbag or MCM logo backpack in pale pink, as well as various types of Sanrio character accessories, most often featuring the characters My Melody or Kuromi.\n[\n1\n]\n Miss Dior perfume bottles are also vastly popular and a common perfume choice. Older adult women invested in the fashion sense can also seen drinking various types of alcohol, like \"Strong Zero\" with a straw, presumably to not disturb their makeup.\n[\n13\n]\n\nAttitude\n[\n]\n\nOn top of the style standing out, Jirai Kei also has a unique attitude of wanting to be in charge, or pushing to be seen and recognized. This slightly rebellious attitude is often seen in those who wear the style; underage high school girls can be seen smoking, drinking, and wandering city streets at night as part of this behavior. It also has ties to even darker themes, such as public promotion of self harm and underage prostitution (see the above \nControversy\n section).\n\nPopularity\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nManga cover featuring Yua Takahashi from \"Tomorrow, I'll Be Someone's Girlfriend\" (明日、私は誰かのカノジョ)\n \n \n\nDespite Jirai Kei being a younger and controversial subculture, it has seen some rise in popularity. Particularly, it has been covered by online magazines who reported about celebrities taking part in the initial makeup challenge, as well as featured by Japanese influencers and beauty gurus who created makeup tutorials for archiving the various looks.\n[\n8\n]\n During the height of its popularity, Jirai Kei's initial style has also been worn by the popular Japanese model Tsubasa Masuwaka, and she described it as \"cute with a gothic edge\".\n[\n18\n]\n\nAlthough it hasn't gained much media traction overseas, Jirai Kei has been mentioned a bit in various English media.\n[\n8\n]\n There also has been a slight increase of general awareness about the subculture due to the drama adaption of the manga \"Tomorrow, I Will Be Someone's Girlfriend\" with the character \"Yua\" representing both the stereotype as well as the style. Music featuring Jirai Kei characters has also become popular in the mainstream, with songs such as DECO*27's \"The Vampire\" featuring Hatsune Miku dressing and acting as a landmine girl reaching nearly 70M views as of late 2023.\n[\n19\n]\n\nBrands & Shops\n[\n]\n\nAnk Rouge\n\nAmilige\n\nBubbles\n\nDarrdy\n\nDearMyLove\n\nLafary\n\nLiz Lisa\n\nMA*RS\n\nNoemie\n\nReflem\n\nRojita\n\nSubcul Zirai\n\nTravas Tokyo\n\nViviene Westwood\n\nYosuke USA\n\nGallery\n[\n]\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n↑ \n1.0\n \n1.1\n \n1.2\n \n1.3\n \n\"Appearing all over Kabukicho!

Labeling the music with a loaded word like \nmenhera, \nhowever, is simply insensitive, if not disturbing in the way it flattens depression into a supposedly recognizable aesthetic. But trivializing mental illness in such a manner is a phenomenon perpetuated to this day in Japanese culture one way or another through bands like Milky Way—who frequently comes up in these \nmenhera\n rock lists—still using it as a hashtag for \ntheir new music\n or the recent viral meme of \njirai meiku\n—\na red-based make-up style to mimic the look of a \njirai jyoshi,\n or a girl who appears fine on the surface but actually unstable.\nThe ease in which \nmenhera\n is thrown partly has to do with the word’s origin as internet slang. First appearing in the 2010s, the term is a portmanteau of \nmentaru herusu\n, or mental health, added with the suffix of -er that was first used to refer to people perusing the mental health threads on 2chan, according to \nWeblio\n.\nThe term made its way into music early on that decade as well. Another popular rock band in these lists, Mio Yamazaki uploaded “\nMenhera\n” to YouTube in 2013, and the song illustrates the common sensibilities exhibited by those who get grouped as \nmenhera\n rock. The lyrical content is more emotionally frank, depressive, and aggressive compared to the average pop song. The verses ignore pop brevity and instead like to go on long-winded. The scrolling lyric video not only gets at how much the lyrics bleed over the margins but also how it resembles raw internet text, either on forums, IMs or iPhone conversations, thrown onto music. I imagine this is how an unlikely candidate like the acoustic-guitar-carrying Aimyon can get lumped into a list like this, through her Line-inspired music video for “\nAnatakaiboujyunaika ~Shine~\n”—or “The Dissection of You as a Love Song: Die.”\nIt’s unfortunate that these artists get grouped under such a crass category because their music itself is valuable in the way it taps into topics then not often found in mainstream pop. Not only do these artists not hold back from voicing emotions like depression, obsession and self-loathing, they present them as ugly and messy as they feel. The guitar riffs are often jagged, sometimes woven in complicated knots, while the singers don’t care if their voices are abrasive compared to the average pop singer. The misshapen qualities as well as their intensity only make the music feel more visceral and personal.\nWhile commonalities within in this type of music might emerge, establishing a subgenre for these works just creates more issues. Identifying these modes of expression as genre tropes flatten the perception of the music. Rounding the artists under a term such as \nmenhera\n only attaches stigma to not only the types of conversation they start but the methods in which they express those topics. It’s worth mentioning quite a few acts that people fit into this category are either women or voiced by women, who are also subjected to adjacent terms such as \njirai-onna\n and \nmenhera joshi\n more than men. “When I express sadness or anger, I’m told ‘ you’re \nmenhera\n,’ when I try to speak with logic, I’m told ‘that’s not cute,’” \nHaru Nemuri tweeted in 2018\n. Popularizing the describing of music as \nmenhera\n only creates more misogynistic ways to shut down art made by women.\nDuring the latter half of the decade, artists whose music get described as \nmenhera\n seems to have accepted just how vapid the term has become. “I found a tweet recently that said, ‘I’m \nmenhera\n so I listened to Seiko Oomori’ with a lot of emojis on it,” \nSeiko Oomori said to Cinra in 2016\n. “\nMenhera\n doesn’t mean much. People who actually take medication aren’t listening to my songs.” The term has taken a similar life to how the word “depression” has been used on social media with ironic distance making it meaningless as much as it made its topics easier to discuss.\nThe problematic treatment might complicate the perception of the music, but the works of these artists still manage to leave a sizable impact for the future. The more depressive themes seem not only more commonplace in pop but also more accessible in recent years. The conversations stemming from these themes appear on rather unassuming pop at least relative to the more intense music that came before. You can definitely chalk up the change in attitude to the uncertain times, but part of that I think also has to do with these artists who confronted these dark emotions in their music despite whatever insensitive name they were being called.\n***\nPhew! A longer essay to start this issue, so I’ll keep it short here. Album of the Week is technically not so new, but I have my reasons why it’s there. Please enjoy the singles but please do enjoy the Oricon revisit, especially if you like Yellow Magic Orchestra. Happy listening!\nAlbum of the Week\nDeep Blue\n by Sora Tob Sakana [NBC Universal]\nRecommended track: “\nSignal\n” \n| \nListen to it on \nSpotify\nThe trajectory of Sora Tob Sakana in the past year has felt a tad uncertain after a member’s graduation reducing the idol group down to a trio, but their music has been more promising than ever. The lack of predictability in their future translated to something more creatively optimistic with last year’s full-length, \nWorld Fragment Tour\n, suggesting that their already-well-defined math-rock sound still had a lot more room to grow. It was a shock, then, to hear the group announce that they will disband this fall after releasing what will be their last full-length album, \nDeep Blue\n.\nAdmittedly, \nDeep Blue\n is not entirely new. While it is bookended by two new songs, “\nSignal\n” and “\nUntie\n,” the rest consists of re-recording of old songs, a good half pulled from their self-titled 2016 album. The new context that surrounds the group, however, transforms the songs from their original state. Familiar lyrics now bear new meanings, and the awe-inspiring music functions with a different purpose. \nDeep Blue\n resonates deeper than just a greatest-hits collection, offering a second look at Sora Tob Sakana’s most cherished songs.\nThe group’s early songs thrived off of innocence and naivete. Part of that came from the idols’ own lack of context with the music they worked with. “In the beginning, we actually sang and performed without understanding that the songs were difficult,” \nFuuka Kanzaki said\n about recording their tracks produced by Yoshimasa Terui, who also leads math-rock-inspired bands such as siraph. Led by their meek voices, Sora Tob Sakana’s self-titled album brought an experience as though you were discovering these new sounds and emotions alongside them. Those sounds unfurl even more vividly thanks to the album’s remastering job, the guitars benefiting the most as the tinny riffs get restored so they can shine as vibrant and dynamic as they should.\nChildish innocence fades away from those familiar songs as they return with more experience but also the foresight of their imminent split. The exuberant music once suggested a lush world full of infinite possibilities; now, that same exuberance instead communicates their time rapidly slipping away. “Tick, tock, time still passes by / No one can stop it / Like it will probably go on forever / I’m not a kid anymore.” Such lyrics hits poignant now with their numbered days in mind, and even more when you realize it comes from their first-ever single, “\nYozora Wo Zenbu\n.”\nIt’s bittersweet to consider that Sora Tob Sakana’s early triumphs have also become their swan song, but \nDeep Blue\n ultimately sings a life well lived rather than wallowing in melancholy. The rock music, a mix of wide-eyed electronica and zipping math-rock, still explodes with inimitable energy, and the added polish to the production pumps even more soul for the group’s last hurrah. The idols’ voices, too, have grown sharper, showing off more control of their complex surroundings. Not only do they sound wiser when it comes to articulating their emotions, the three seem unfazed whenever they sing lyrics about the overwhelming speed of life. Sora Tob Sakana accept their time has come to an end, and their embrace of finality inspires a whole new perspective of their music.\nSingles Club\n“Cream” by macominaming [Oiran Music]\nMacominaming’s latest track lulls in and out of a comforting slumber as the glowing synths hum a sleepy tune. The indie-pop duo, too, seems deep in a their dreams as the two softly whisper a verse about how they can’t tell up from down. Their stroll through the subconscious sounds like a delight especially as they get to the hook, stretching out the long syllable of the titular word like sweet taffy.\nListen to the single on \nBandcamp\n.\nSee also:\n “\nSettee\n” by Newly ft. Kojikoji; “\nAfter Five\n” by O’chawanz\n“Yes and No” by Dreams Come True [Universal Sigma]\nI started watching the medical TV drama \nUnsung Cinderella: Midori, The Hospital Pharmacist\n about a few weeks ago. The episodes remain pretty earnest without too many pockets of comedy, and so I expected a theme song from Dreams Come True that’s just as sincere and sentimental—a mood that the duo have historically nailed with their collection of drama-theme-turned-hits. But as the episode entered its final sappy moments, I noticed, hey, do I hear a break beat? Considering the duo’s \njolly \nasadora\n entry\n from last year, a sly inclusion of drum breaks was a big curve ball that I had to investigate a bit further.\n“Yes and No” really is one of the edgiest singles to come from the J-pop veterans. R&B has been their foundation since the ‘90s, but the fancy electronic production here is something else. The retro new wave could be easily re-fitted into a synthwave track; if you enjoyed the icy Vangelis synths of The Weeknd’s \nAfter Hours\n, the sleek, cinematic flair of this single should also excite. Miwa Yoshida and her soulful vocals gel well with the lush music, adding a golden feel as though “Yes and No” is a lost pop hit from the opulent ‘80s.\nListen to the single on \nSpotify\n.\nSee also:\n “\nUtopia\n” by AAAMYYY; “\nNight D\n” by Eill\n“Snooze” by Zombie-Chang [Roman Label / Bayon Production]\nMeirin Yung has been playing with electro this year, releasing the resulting one-offs on her YouTube page, and the synth-twiddling experiments come to full fruition in her new Zombie-Chang album, \nTake Me Away from Tokyo\n. The spastic electronics such as the one firing off in “Snooze” initially made for more extroverted music relative to her previous output, which seemed conflicting at first with what I enjoy about Yung’s songs. My favorite singles of hers try and fail at fighting against inertia, never quite reaching full catharsis.\nThe more I immerse myself into the wonky sounds, however, the song becomes as hypnotic as her previous releases with the crowding of noise inviting sensory paralysis. The overwhelm is fitting for such a song with Yung wandering in a half-asleep state while a buzzing alarm echoes in the distance—”gotta shut it off,” she repeats in her signature dead-pan cadence as the iPhone ringer incessantly beeps.\nTake Me Away from Tokyo \nis out now. Listen to it on \nSpotify\n.\nSee also:\n “\nMurmur\n” by Pasocom Music Club; “\nTurbulence\n” by Wata Igarashi\nThis Week in 1981…\n“High School Lullaby” by Imo-Kin Trio [For Life, 1981]\nNo. 1 during the weeks of Aug. 24 - Oct. 5, 1981\n | \nListen to it on \nYouTube\nThe Oricon charts truly feel like the Wild West sometimes with it allowing space for an act like Imo-Kin Trio to climb up to number one. None of the three in the group are musicians but instead talents in entertainment, who starred as regulars in the variety TV program \nKindon! Yoiko Waruiko Futsunoko\n. While TV spawned hits either through a drama series or audition programs, Imo-Kin Trio was one of the first where a variety show assembled their talents to debut a pop group. \nThe resulting debut single “High School Lullaby” provides a neat look at what was trendy in Japanese pop at the time in 1981. Imo-Kin Trio’s name is a portmanteau of YMO, or Yellow Magic Orchestra, and Johnny’s idol group Tanokin Trio, and the group’s initial make-up essentially resembles what you’d imagine as the other end of that bizarre boy-band formula. The former’s Haruomi Hosono produced the music; the technopop new wave is definitely the work of the master, down to the drum-machine count-in that echoes “\nRydeen\n.” The three sing about their one-sided crush over the skipping electronic beat, the chorus featuring one saccharine hook: “\nbaby, I love you / so suki suki baby\n,” they call out in unison.\nThe origin story sets a precedent for a lot of the future TV-born novelty hits in the Oricon. The trio loosely stands as a reference for something like the music career of comedy duo Tunnels, whose star status retroactively feeds into the appeal of the music that they put out on the side during the ‘80s and early ‘90s. The launch of Imo-Kin definitely cast a shadow over the novelty records that came straight from the segments of the Heisei variety program \nTunnels No Minasan No Okagedeshita\n: the debut of Yaen in 1998 from the show essentially updates the YMO rip of “High School Lullaby” into \na Kinki Kids parody\n.\nThe difference with Imo-Kin is that the members had just got into television with \nKindon!\n and so “High School Lullaby” is propelled more by the trendiness of YMO than necessarily the star power of the involved talents. Conversely, though, it goes to show how the world of Japanese television can launch just about any music career through sheer synergy even if the talents in question have little ambitions to establish themselves in the music realm. The fact that they succeeded using YMO as their vehicle is a cherry on top to one peculiar pop story.\nNext issue is out September 2. \nYou can check out previous issues here\n.

Though there are a lot of words and the list just goes on and on, I chose the basic ones and what I think would be interesting for everyone to know!\n\nNow the big question:\n WHAT THE HELL IS AN OSHI?\n\n• Oshi (推し/おし)\n\n– the word oshi literally means\n “push”\n but it is now the common term used for people who is a fan of something or someone.\n– can also be referred to a person who likes a group or a person who likes a certain member.\n– also commonly known as \n“stan/bias”\n in western fan terms.\nExample:\n私はABC推しです ➡️ (I am a fan of ABC)\n推しはAさん➡️ (The person I am a fan of is A-san)\n***Do note that the word ‘Oshi’ is widely used not only in the idol scene but also actors, voice actors, anime/game characters and so much more!***\n\n• \nTan-Oshi (単推し/たんおし)\n\n– term used for someone who’s only loyal to one person or member.\n– this is also popularly known as \n“Top Oshi”\n\n• Hako-Oshi (箱推し/はこおし)\n\n– literally means \n“Box Push”\n– it is the term use to liking all members of a group.\nTo simply break it down:\n箱 (hako) ➡️ the whole group\n推し (oshi) ➡️ support\n\n• Oshi Kaburi (推し被り)\n\n– this refers to having the same oshi as an another fan.\n\n•\n DD\n\n– means “\nD\naredemo \nD\naisuki”\n– this refer to fans who doesn’t have one favorite member in a group but rather loves multiple members of the group.\n– also most commonly known as “multi-fandom”.\n\n• Wotaku (ヲタク)\n\n– it is mostly abbreviated as \nヲタ\n which means fan.\nファン\n (fan) is the common mainstream term. BUT!!\nヲタク\n (wotaku) has more deeper feel than being just a ‘fan’.\nAn example situation for Fan VS Wotaku:\nFan ➡️ “He is handsome. I like him.”\nWotaku ➡️ “He is so handsome!!! I’M CRYING I LOVE HIM SO MUCH!!! Ahhh ;;; “\n//That kind of feeling! LOL\n\n• Onna wota-wota (女ヲタヲタ)\n\n– means “Female fan’s fans” //I know sounds weird.\n– this term is referred to someone who does not like the idol/group but rather who likes their female fans instead.\n– mostly seen going to the live concert site not to watch and support the idols but to see their female fans. YIKES. PLS ALWAYS BE CAREFUL!\n\n• Gachi-koi (ガチ恋/がちこい)\n\n– means falling in love with their oshi.\n– transformed from being just an ordinary fan to really want to fall in love with them.\n– this is mostly used by male fans.\n\n• Riako (リアコ)\n\n– it’s a short term for “I’m in real love” / “\nRia\nru ni \nKo\ni shiteru” (リアルに恋してる)\n– Riako and Gachi-koi have similar meanings but this is only used by female fans.\n\n•\n Kenashi Ai (貶し愛/けなしあい)\n\n– this means saying hateful words/hating the person you like but deep inside it is a form of expressing your love for them aka “Playful rudeness”. Much like a Tsundere(??) LOLOL\n– pretty common thing for this is making memes out of their oshi’s /ugly/ faces or expressions.\n\n• Niwaka Ame (にわか雨)\n\n– it is used as a negative connotation for people who became fans only because of a sudden surge of popularity of a certain series/group but then it dies down when the hype is not there anymore aka most commonly known as the “mainstreamers”.\n\nThe “niwaka” is written in kanji as 「\n俄\n」 which means “suddenly”.\nThe word \n‘niwaka ame’\n in japanese means\n ‘rain shower’\n and just like rain showers it pours then it stops. In addition to that, ‘niwaka’ is also an abbreviation for the theatre act called \n“Niwaka Kyogen”\n an on the spot type of play that was held on the streets during Edo period and was very popular during at that time.\nThere is no negative element in the word “niwaka” but the fan term for it is becoming more common nowadays. Please do refrain from using it to other fans!\n\n• MIHA (ミーハー)\n\n– has similar meaning to ‘niwaka’\n– this refers to people who are easily influenced\n– aka follower of new trends\nA situational example for that is when originally, you were not interested in liking this certain group/idol (or even a series) but everyone around you was very into it so you checked it out and became a fan.\nThere are many theories for the etymology of this word so I will present 3 of those!\n1. During Showa Era, there were many young women whose name starts with “mi” (み) and “ha” (は). Those who were called “Mi-chan” and “Ha-chan” are referred to as young women who are obsessed with their hobbies and had little to no educational background. Nowadays, it’s also used thoroughly among men.\n2. It’s a combination of the popular japanese dessert called “Mitsumame” and an old stage name of a well known Showa actor, “Chojiro Hayashi”\n3. It comes from the words “Me” and “Her” in the english language.\n\n• Resu (レス)\n\n– means response\n– refers to the idol’s response to you during events or live concerts, such as waving at you or doing what’s written in your “uchiwa”!\n\n• All Pass (ぜんつう)\n\n– someone who participates in all concerts and activities of their oshi hence the term ‘All Pass’\n\n• Jizou (地蔵/じぞう)\n\n– someone who’s at the event/live concert and just quietly looks at the idols and performers\n– basically motionless\n\n• Kakoi (囲い/かこい)\n\n– someone who’s watching a live stream and spams in the comment section in an attempt to attract the attention of the one who’s broadcasting.\n\n•\n Pile Up (積む積み/つむつみ)\n\n– a fan who bought too many copies of the same cd/merchandise\n– this is very common for fans especially when purchasing \n\n• Number of Goods = Love\n\n– its called\n グッズ量参戦歴 = 愛\n but ofc that wouldn’t make sense when I translate it word by word LOL i think??? don’t sue me pls\n– basically this means “The number of merchandise you have of your oshi/ how many times you participated in concerts = LOVE”\nA gentle reminder that not buying merchs of your oshi’s doesn’t make you less any of a fan! I’ve heard from other’s experiences that they are starving themselves and would rather buy merchs and sacrifice buying their own personal needs. I have totally nothing against buying merchs because if it makes you happy, then go for it. I know the experience all too well since I love collecting and buying merch as well.\nBut PLEASE prioritize your money when you have to!\n\n• Takai (他界/たかい)\n\n– can also mean “another world” or “graduate”\n(Ex: I have graduated from being a fan of this group. )\n– refers to someone who has stopped being a fan due to various reasons.\n\n• Kamitaiou (神対応/かみたいおう)\n\n– aka “God’s Response”\n– refers to an idol who has a good response to fans.\nAn example for this is when an idol reads fanmails from fans and shares his thoughts.\n\n• Shiotaiou (塩対応/しおたいおう)\n\n– basically the opposite of “kamitaiou”\n\n• Hair Make (ヘアメク)\n\n– just as the name suggests, its about styling hair! This is very popular among female fans and they usually go to the salon to make their hair look cute and stylish before a live concert or even when they just hang out with their friends.\nIn hair make you can put your oshi accessories! Think of it like an itabag, but for hair!\nPrice ranges about from ¥2000-¥5,000 om an average but it usually depends on the salon and how complex the style that you want to achieve ♡\n\n• Oshi Ga Toutoi (推しが尊い)\n\n– means “My Oshi is precious”\nWhen you look up at the dictionary the word \n「尊い」\n means precious. However, the meaning is different now that it is a word that cannot be expressed by mere words alone and shows the highest degree form of liking your oshi.\nIt is an emotion that goes beyond “like” and “love” and is now on the level of loyalty and faith.\nThis word contains many meanings but has the same concept around it!\n\n⋆ ˚｡⋆୨୧˚　˚୨୧⋆｡˚ ⋆\nBonus Information:\n\nOshi’s around the net usually put an intro (its like a “carrd”) on their SNS’s where you’ll get to know more about them! They usually have these symbols to indicate what’s OK and not OK!\n◎ – Very OK, Approves\n○ – OK, Supports, Yes\n△ – Partially OK (between ○ and X)\nX – Absolutely not allowed, Prohibited\n\nI hope this was helpful!\nThank you so much for reading! \n⋆ ˚｡⋆୨୧˚　˚୨୧⋆｡˚ ⋆\n\nShare this:\n\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\n\nX\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\nFacebook\n\nLike\n \nLoading...\n\nRelated\n\n \n\nShare this:\n\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\n\nX\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\nFacebook\n\nLike\n \nLoading...\n \n\n One thought on “\nOshi Terms 101 : A Guide\n”\n\nI am currently learning japanese by myself and I’ve just found this blog in a desperate try to interact more with JP fandoms🥺🥺🥺 All of this info was very useful, thank you so much😭😭😭❤️\n\nLike\nLike\n\nReply\n \n\nLeave a comment \nCancel reply\n \n\nArchives\n\nAugust 2020\n (5)\n\nMay 2020\n (1)\n\nFollow Yumemipi's Outlet ♥ on WordPress.com\n\n \n\n \nComment \n\nReblog\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribed\n\n Yumemipi's Outlet ♥ \n\n Already have a WordPress.com account? \nLog in now.\n \n\n \n\n Yumemipi's Outlet ♥ \n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribed\n\nSign up\n\nLog in\n\nCopy shortlink\n\n Report this content \n\n View post in Reader \n\nManage subscriptions\n\nCollapse this bar\n\n \n\nLoading Comments...\n\n \n\n%d\n\n \n\n \nDesign a site like this with WordPress.com\nGet started", "language": "lang_en", "country": "us"}

Statements consisting only of original research should be removed.\n \n(\nJanuary 2025\n)\n (\nLearn how and when to remove this message\n)\n\nJapanese street fashion\n refers to a number of styles of contemporary modern clothing in \nJapan\n. Created from a mix of both local and foreign fashion brands, Japanese \nstreet fashions\n tend to have their own distinctive style, with some considered to be extreme and \nimaginative\n, with similarities to the \nhaute couture\n styles seen on European \ncatwalks\n.\n\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\n\nAs early as the 1950s, there were a few brands specially catered to street fashion, such as \nOnitsuka Tiger\n (now known as \nASICS\n).\n\nIn addition, the emergence of strong youth culture in the 1960s and 1970s that continues today (especially in \nHarajuku\n, a district in Shibuya, Tokyo) drives much of the development of new styles, looks, and fashion subcultures. The rise of \nconsumerism\n, which played an important part in Japan's \"national character\" during its economic boom in the 1980s, continues to influence fashion purchases, even after this economic bubble burst in the 1990s. These factors result in the swift turnover and variability in styles popular at any one time.\n[\n1\n]\n\nIn 2003, \nJapanese hip-hop\n, which had long been present among underground Tokyo's club scene, influenced the mainstream fashion industry.\n[\n2\n]\n The popularity of the music was so influential that Tokyo's youth imitated their favorite hip hop stars from the way they dress with oversized clothes to tanned skin.\n[\n3\n]\n\nThough extremely popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, many trends experienced a levelling off in the later 2000s and onwards; the rise and fall of many of these trends had been chronicled by \nShoichi Aoki\n since 1997 in the fashion magazine \nFruits\n, which was a notable magazine for the promotion of street fashion in Japan.\n[\n4\n]\n\nFashion industry and popular brands\n[\nedit\n]\n\nComme des Garçons garments on display at the \nMetropolitan Museum of Art\n\nAlthough Japanese street fashion is known for its mix-match of different styles and genres, and there is no single sought-after brand that can consistently appeal to all fashion groups, the huge demand created by the fashion-conscious population is fed and supported by Japan's vibrant fashion industry. \nIssey Miyake\n, \nYohji Yamamoto\n and \nComme des Garçons\n are often said to be the three cornerstone brands of Japanese fashion. Together they were particularly recognized as a Japanese fashion force in the early 1980s for their intensive use of \nmonochrome\n color and cutting-edge design.\n\nThe social motives driving interaction with and involvement in personal fashion choices and wider fashion movements within Japan are complex. Firstly, the comparatively large quantity of disposable income available to Japanese youth is significant; many argue this has been, historically, made possible through a greater degree of Japanese youth living at home with their parents for much longer than in other countries, reducing living expenses and thus making larger spending on clothing possible.\n[\n5\n]\n\nJapan is also known for its significant consumption of foreign luxury brands. According to data from 2006, Japan consumed 41 percent of the entire world's \nluxury goods\n.\n[\n6\n]\n The blue line of \nBurberry\n is among the most successful in this arena.\n\nJapanese street fashion influences the \nWest Coast of the United States\n.\n[\n7\n]\n High-end fashion brands like \nComme des Garçons\n have played a big role in the global industry since the 1980s, especially through frequent cross-over guest design with other brands. In 2008, \nRei Kawakubo\n designed for \nLouis Vuitton\n[\n8\n]\n and \nH&M\n.\n[\n9\n]\n Harajuku Fashion was ranked 5th in the fashion field of Google Search of the Year in 2019.\n[\n10\n]\n\nModern Japanese street fashion\n[\nedit\n]\n\nThough the styles have changed over the years, street fashion is still prominent in \nTokyo\n today. Young adults can often be found wearing subculture attire in large urban fashion districts such as \nHarajuku\n (\nUra-Harajuku\n), \nAoyama\n, \nGinza\n, \nOdaiba\n, \nShinjuku\n and \nShibuya\n.\n\nLolita\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nLolita fashion\n\nSweet Lolita (left) and Gothic Lolita (right)\n\nContaining many different themes within its boundaries, Lolita has become one of the larger, more recognizable styles in Japanese street fashion and has gained a following worldwide. Skirts or dresses are usually worn at or below knee length with petticoats beneath for volume. Blouses or tops are lace-trimmed or ruffled in the Victorian or Rococo style. The length of the socks or stockings can go from ankle to thigh level and may be topped with lace. Wearers of this fashion style often put on \nMary Janes\n, tea party shoes, or boots. The more well-known sub-styles within Lolita fashion are as follows:\n\nGothic Lolita - Lolita with a heavy influence from the Eastern and Victorian Goth style. Often characterized by dark colors and accessories adorned with motifs such as skeletons, bats, spiders, and other popular gothic 'icons', such as characters from \nTim Burton\n films. Victorian iron gates and architectural designs are also often seen in dress prints. Bonnets, rectangle headdresses, and brooches are popular accessories for Gothic Lolita.\n\nSweet Lolita - the most childlike style, mostly characterized by baby animals, fairy tale themes, and innocent, childlike attire. It was originally inspired by Victorian children's clothing and the \nkawaii\n culture that is very prevalent in Japan. Pastel colors are often used, although some dresses or skirts may feature darker or muted colors as well. Large head bows, cute purses, and stuffed animals are popular accessories for Sweet Lolita.\n\nClassic Lolita - a sub-style more closely resembling the historical fashion of the Rococo or Victorian eras. The colors that are used in this look are usually muted, thus giving this sub-style a more mature feel. Floral prints and solid colors are common, although fancier prints are not unheard of as well. Small head bows, bonnets, rectangle headdresses, and hair corsages are popular accessories for Classic Lolita.\n\nPunk Lolita - an experimental style, mixing the influences of Punk with Lolita. It can sometimes look deconstructed or crazy while keeping most of the 'Lolita silhouette'.\n\nOuji - also known as 'boy style', are the more masculine counterparts of lolita, influenced by Victorian boys' clothing. 'Prince pants', which are short capri-style pants that are cut off the knee, usually with some sort of detail (such as lace-edged cuffs) are commonly worn with masculine blouses, top hats, knee socks, and other accessories.\n[\n11\n]\n\nGyaru\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nGyaru\n\nGyaru\n being photographed in \nIkebukuro\n in 2009\n\nGyaru\n (sometimes known as \nGanguro\n, actually a subcategory of \ngyaru\n), is a type of Japanese street fashion that originated in the 1970s. \nGyaru\n focuses on girly-glam style, dwelling on man-made beauty, such as wigs, fake lashes, and fake nails. \nGyaru\n is also heavily inspired by Western fashion.\n\nGanguro\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nGanguro\n\nTwo \nganguro\n girls in Tokyo, April 2008\n\nThe \nGanguro\n style of Japanese street fashion became popular among Japanese girls in the early 1990s and peaked in the early 2000s. \nGanguro\n falls into the larger subculture of \ngyaru\n fashion. \nGanguro\n typically includes brightly colored outfits, mini-skirts, and tie-dyed \nsarongs\n. The \nganguro\n style consists of bleached hair, a deep tan, fake eyelashes, black and white eyeliner, bracelets, earrings, rings, necklaces, and platform shoes.\n\nMany people consider \nNamie Amuro\n to have been the leading figure of \nganguro\n style. Exactly after her public appearances with tanned skin and dyed hair, a lot of Japanese girls started to follow her example. The terms \n\"Yamanba\"\n and \n\"Manba\"\n refer to the extreme ends of the \nGanguro\n style. However, enthusiasts of both the \nYamanba\n and \nManba\n styles consider \nganguro\n as an \"easy version\" of their style. Nowadays, the name \n'Yamanba'\n has shortened to \n'Manba'\n. \n\n[\n12\n]\n\nKogal\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nKogal\n\nA \nkogal\n identified by her \nloose socks\n and shortened skirt\n\nThe \nKogal\n (\nKogyaru\n) look is based on a high school uniform, but with a shorter skirt, \nloose socks\n, and often dyed hair and scarf as well. Members of the \nKogal\n style sometimes refer to themselves as \nGyaru\n (gals). This style was prominent in the 1990s, and it started gaining popularity again at the end of 2020, however it is an age category specifically for gals in high school.\n\nBōsōzoku\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nBōsōzoku\n\nJapanese \ncosplayers\n dressed up in \nbōsōzoku\n-style outfits\n\nWhile \nbōsōzoku\n fashion has not been widely popular since the 1990s, the stereotypical \nBōsōzoku\n look is often portrayed, and even caricatured, in many forms of Japanese media such as anime, manga, and films. The typical \nbōsōzoku\n member is often depicted in a uniform consisting of a \njumpsuit\n like those worn by manual laborers or a \ntokko-fuku\n (\n特攻服\n)\n, a type of military issued over-coat with \nkanji\n slogans. These are usually worn open, with no shirt underneath, showing off bandaged torsos and matching baggy pants tucked inside tall boots.\n\nAmekaji\n[\nedit\n]\n\nAmekaji is a style based on American casual, often narrowly defined as Western/Native American/Biker-based. Amekaji was introduced to the public in the early 1990s by a group of delinquents in \nShibuya\n known as \"Teamer\". Later, it was popularized by \nTakuya Kimura\n who wore it in his TV dramas.\n\nDecora Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nExample of Decora fashion\n\nThe \nDecora Kei\n style originated in the late 1990s/early 2000s and rose to great popularity both in and outside Japan. It is exemplified by singer \nKyary Pamyu Pamyu\n, who rose to prominence in the \nHarajuku\n fashion scene before her musical debut. The wearers usually stick to a color scheme for their decora, such as Pink Decora, Red Decora, Dark Decora, and Rainbow Decora. A plain shirt and hoodie were often worn with short \ntutu\n-like skirts. The hair (often worn in low ponytails with long bangs) and make-up itself tend to be quite plain. However, the most significant part of \nDecora Kei\n is to pile on many layers of cute accessories until the bangs and front hair is barely visible. Stockings, legwarmers, arm warmers, and knee socks are also worn over each other in different layers. Common details also include \nleopard prints\n and patterned \ndental masks\n. The style has since decreased in popularity but still has a large following worldwide.\n\nVisual \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nVisual Kei\n\nVisual \nkei\n band \nVersailles\n\nVisual \nKei\n is a subculture created in the mid-1980s by Japanese musicians consisting of striking makeup, unusual hair styles, and flamboyant costumes, similar to Western \nglam rock\n and \nglam metal\n. \nAndrogyny\n is also a popular aspect of the style. Some of the more well-known and influential artists of the style include \nX Japan\n, \nLuna Sea\n, \nVersailles\n, \nThe Gazette\n, \nMejibray\n, \nRoyz\n, \nL'Arc-en-Ciel\n, \nAn Cafe\n, \nMalice Mizer\n, and \nDiaura\n.\n\nOshare Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nOshare Kei\n is the opposite side of Visual \nKei\n, with bright colors and many pop impressions. This said, bands under this style live up to the meaning by dressing up in colorful costumes, or in \nDecora\n or \nPop Kei\n style; many are seen sporting large amounts of jewelry and bags of anime characters and animals slung on, many colorful hairclips, and lighter make-up. The music is more happy sounding, the lyrics lighter and happier. Bands include \nAn Cafe\n, \nPanic Channel\n, Ichigo69, Lolita23q, \nSug\n, Delacroix, \nLM.C\n, and Aicle.\n[\n13\n]\n\nAngura Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nAngura Kei\n is a dark Japanese fashion that is often associated with a subgenre of \nVisual Kei\n. The term derives from the Japanese pronunciation of \"underground\", which refers to its origins in underground theater. The clothes tend to be heavily influenced by traditional Japanese elements as well as the \nShowa era\n (1926–1989) but with a Goth spin to it. The make-up usually consists of \nshironuri\n and is dark and heavy. While kimono is the most commonly used by visual \nkei\n artists, the style also often features modified Japanese school uniforms. Motifs and accessories are themed around post-war Japan and the occult.\n\nCult Party \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nCult Party \nKei\n, named after the Harajuku shop \nCult Party\n (now known as the \nVirgin Mary\n), is a style that was popular around the early 2010s and is based on Western religious artifacts like crosses or bibles. Common aspects include crosses wired in yarn, layers of fabric in soft colors, lots of cream lace and satin bows. The make-up and hairstyle is not as over the top as other styles. Cult Party \nKei\n is often worn with natural-looking make-up without any larger emphasis on the eyes and simple hair-dos with roses. Cult Party \nKei\n is considered by some to be a subset of Dolly \nKei\n.\n\nDolly \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nDolly \nKei\n is a style based on Japan's view of the \nMiddle Ages\n and European \nfairy tales\n, especially the \nBrothers Grimm\n and \nHans Christian Andersen\n. It includes a lot of vintage-style clothing and sometimes has religious symbols. \nGrimoire\n is a store in Japan that has been described as \"the pioneering store behind the Dolly-\nkei\n fashion scene\".\n[\n14\n]\n\nFairy \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nFairy \nKei\n is a youthful style based on 1980s fashion that evokes a dreamy, nostalgic feeling. Outfits are made up of pastel colors, angels, toys and generally cute motifs and elements and accessories from Western toy lines of the 1980s and early 1990s, such as \nPolly Pocket\n, \nMy Little Pony\n, \nStrawberry Shortcake\n, \nRainbow Brite\n, \nPopples\n, \nLady Lovely Locks\n, \nBarbie\n, \nWuzzles\n, and \nCare Bears\n. Pastel-colored hair is common, although natural hair is also popular, and hairstyles are usually kept simple and decorated with anything cute or pastel; bows are a common theme. Some common items used in a Fairy Kei coordinate include vintage sweaters, cardigans, varsity jackets, tutus, mini skirts, tights, over-the-knee socks, sneakers, and tea party shoes. The term \"Fairy \nKei\n\" originated from the magazine called \nZipper\n (despite a common belief that Sayuri Tabuchi [Tavuchi], the owner of Tokyo fashion store \nSpank!\n, was the accidental creator of the style).\n[\n15\n]\n\nGirly \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nGirly \nKei\n is a hyperfeminine Japanese fashion style that emphasizes cute and girlish appearance. As opposed to the definition in English, Girly Kei does not generally only consider everything feminine and mature looks; Girly Kei tends to focus on lace, ribbons, ruffles, and patterns such as flowers and hearts, with soft and pastel colors such as pink being the main focus. There are many substyles and the popular image can vary depending on the current trends has pushed Girly Kei's evolution into a more hyper-feminine and innocent direction during the early 2020s because mainstream fashion trends took heavily from this style.\n\nMori Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMori Kei\n (\nmori\n meaning \"forest\") uses soft, loosely fitting layers of garments such as floaty dresses and cardigans. It places an emphasis on natural fabrics (\ncotton\n, \nlinen\n, \nwool\n) and hand-made or vintage accessories with a nature theme. The color scheme tends to be light and neutral, but patterns such as gingham and florals may also be used. In terms of hairstyles, bangs (often curled) and braids are very popular. The style is similar to Dolly \nKei\n in that the aim is to create a doll-like appearance but in a more casual, earthy manner.\n[\n16\n]\n\nJirai Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nA \nHatsune Miku\n cosplayer wearing Jirai Kei\n\nJirai Kei is the edgier counterpart to the aforementioned Girly Kei fashion style. Jirai Kei, literally meaning \"landmine type\", is a fashion subculture originating from Japan's \nKabukichō\n and spread in popularity in the early 2020s, which incorporates \ndark\n and \nkawaii\n styles. Described as similar to \nLolita\n and \nPreppy\n fashions in clothing, it's often paired with accessories with bow, heart, \ncross\n, and lace elements, and wear \nplatform shoes\n. The primary colors in Jirai Kei are black, white, and pale pink. It highlights femininity, cuteness, and fosters a sense of loveliness with the perfect balance of cool. The stereotype behind this subculture is that cute, hyper-feminine young women who dress in darker fashion styles have personalities that do not match their appearance. Rather than being sweet and kind, they are said to be violent and obsessive.\n[\n17\n]\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n\nGirly fashion has a wide range of different clothing types, like Girly Kei, Jirai Kei fashion has been met by widespread social prejudice, directed towards those who wear Jirai Kei and their lifestyle choices not just about being what western society thinks of as feminine. It highlights lace, ribbons, ruffles, and playful patterns like hearts, with soft pastel pinks as the main focus, perfectly balanced by striking blacks.\n[\n18\n]\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n\nPeeps\n[\nedit\n]\n\nPeeps is a 90s-inspired sporty goth style that has been popularized in Harajuku's underground scene by the online magazine \nPEEPS\n. It was voted one of the major trends for 2020 in the yearly trend forecast by the Japanese women's magazine \nMery\n.\n[\n19\n]\n\nKimono style\n[\nedit\n]\n\nDespite the widespread nature of Western clothing in Japan, Japanese fashion is still influenced by traditional clothing, with people still wearing the \nkimono\n in daily life, though most people wear it only for weddings, graduations, and other formal occasions.\n\nDespite the heavily reduced numbers of people wearing kimono as everyday clothing, the younger generation in Japan can still be seen to mix kimono and modern style in fashion, wearing modern footwear and accessories instead of the typical \ngeta\n and \nkanzashi\n usually worn. There are even modern designers who have used the kimono as inspiration, such as the \"TANZEN\" collection from designer Issey Miyake.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n\nGenderless\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nGenderless fashion in Japan\n\nIn the mid-2010s, genderless fashion became widespread and focused on people wearing clothing that did not conform to their gender. The subculture is mostly dominated by men, who are known as \"genderless men.\"\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n\nDesigners featured at international fashion weeks\n[\nedit\n]\n\nTomoko Yamanaka's work was featured at \nLondon Fashion Week\n, 2010.\n[\n20\n]\n\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\n\nDeconstruction (fashion)\n\n2000s in Japanese fashion\n\n2010s in Asian fashion\n\nYouth culture\n\nCamp (style)\n\nFruits\n\nCuteness in Japanese culture\n\nMadam/Aristocrat\n\nElegant Gothic Aristocrat\n\nNeo-Victorian\n\nCosplay\n\nVisual Kei\n\nPoupee Girl\n\nBaby, the Stars Shine Bright\n\nGyaru\n\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n\n^\n \nGodoy, Tiffany (December 2007).

However, with changes in times and discourse environments, the meaning of the term has evolved based on social realities, developing different nuances. The term itself has also expanded its reach with the advancement of communication technologies, particularly forming a new youth subculture phenomenon in China. This article separately outlines the developmental history of \"Jirai Onna\" in both China and Japan, and provides a distinct summary of the developing history of \"Jirai Onna\" in both China and Japan. Finally, it provides a potential analysis of the factors that contribute to the disparities in the Landmine Girl culture that exist between China and Japan. The expectation is that this will be of use to researchers in the future who are investigating different young subculture organizations.\n\nKeywords: \n\nCultural Differences, Jirai Onna, Subculture\n\n Download PDF\n \n\n View PDF\n\nSun,R.

Social Networking Services (SNS), with their User-Generated Content (UGC) production model, have broken the monopoly of professionals over discourse power, promoting spontaneous communication among ordinary users and fostering a space for the flourishing of niche subcultures.\n\nAs East Asian countries, China and Japan share similar cultural foundations. The languages they use have commonalities in meaning, and their social atmospheres are also more alike. This provides a natural foundation for grassroots cultural exchanges. However, similar to other communication activities, subcultures inevitably present a more localized appearance in the final decoding stage of their dissemination process.\n\nThis paper selects the \"Jirai Kei\" (地雷系) culture originating from Japan, as an example, tracing its history and development in both China and Japan.\" It is more effective to discuss subcultures on the basis of discussing society. The analysis of fictional worlds is closely related to the understanding of the real world \"[1].\n\nMost previous research has focused on the dissemination process of subcultures or the psychological challenges faced by subcultural groups [2][3][4]. Few studies have conducted detailed comparisons of a specific subculture between two countries and explored the communication activities involved.\n\nThis paper aims to provide a reference case for future cross-cultural research and to enhance the objective understanding of the \"Jirai Kei\" culture group by the outside world.\n\n2.\n Main discussion \n\n2.1.\n The history of Jirai Kei culture in Japan \n\nThe origins of Jirai Kei culture can be traced back to the term \"Jirai Onna\" (地雷女), a popular internet catchphrase used around 2010 on the Japanese anonymous forum 2 channel (2ちゃんねる). This term was used to describe women who appeared cute on the surface but had serious issues in intimate relationships. Due to their seemingly harmless exterior hiding a potentially destructive nature—similar to a \"ticking time bomb\"—they were labeled as \"Jirai Onna\" or \"landmine women.\" When used to describe others, the term carries a derogatory connotation, often implying that the person suffers from mental illness. \n\nOther similar catchphrases include \"Pien-kei\" (ぴえん系) and \"Menhera\" (ﾒﾝﾍﾗ). \"Pien-kei\" is widely believed to have emerged around 2018 in the Kabukicho (歌舞伎町) area, named after the popular EMOJI \"Pleading Face\" (ぴえん) frequently used by Japanese youth. The rise of Pien-kei girls is closely tied to Kabukicho's host club industry. Sasaki Chiwawa [5] argues that \"Pien-kei girls essentially desire to be cute, but not everyone can achieve the 'mainstream' cuteness of actresses or models on TV. As a result, they gather in Kabukicho, where spending money can earn them compliments on their cuteness, and they fulfill their desires by spending on hosts.\" Through this behavior, which differs from traditional romantic relationships and is referred to as \"oshi\" (推し), they find meaning in their lives [6]. \n\nThe word \"Menhera\" emerged around the same time as \"Jirai Onna.\" It is a Japanese internet adaptation of the English term \"mental health\" and first appeared in the mental health section of 2channel. This term is most frequently used in Japanese research on Jirai Kei culture and is often associated with mental illnesses such as borderline personality disorder [7].\n\nGoogle search data also shows that \"Jirai Onna\" and \"Menhera\" had similar search frequencies during the same period, while the search curve for \"Pien-kei\" clearly reflects the characteristics of a new catchphrase emerging around 2020.\n\nFigure 1: Global search popularity of \"Jirai Onna\" (Blue Line), \"Menhera\" (Green Line), and \"Pien-kei\" (Red Line) from January 2004 to February 13, 2025\n\nAlthough the three catchphrases—\"Jirai Onna,\" \"Menhera,\" and \"Pien-kei\"—differ in their etymology, origins, and time of emergence, they share similar meanings. All are used to describe individuals (primarily women) who appear delicate and pitiable on the surface but are emotionally unstable or mentally troubled. We collectively refer to these three catchphrases as \"Jirai Kei\" in the following sections.\n\n2.2.\n The current state of Jirai Kei in Japan \n\n2.2.1.\n Jirai Kei as a standalone fashion culture \n\nIn contemporary Japan, Jirai Kei has evolved beyond its original catchphrase to become a distinct fashion subculture. This transformation reflects the complex interplay between online identity and real-world expression of young people.\n\nJirai Kei is characterized by its mix of cuteness and darkness, often incorporating elements such as pastel colors, frilly dresses, and childlike accessories alongside darker motifs like crosses, bandages, and gothic-inspired details. This aesthetic serves as a visual metaphor for the inner turmoil and emotional instability associated with the Jirai Kei identity. \n\nThe rise of Jirai Kei as a fashion trend can be attributed to its resonance with individuals who feel marginalized or misunderstood by mainstream society. By adopting this style, they express their struggles with mental health, relationships, and societal pressures in a way that is both personal and communal. Social media platforms, particularly Instagram and Twitter, have played a significant role in popularizing Jirai Kei fashion, allowing individuals to share their outfits, connect with like-minded people, and build a sense of belonging. Jirai Kei as a youth subculture reflect the values of youths today and resist elements of society in a visually stimulating way [8].\n\nHowever, the commercialization of Jirai Kei fashion had sparked debates. Some critics argue that the subculture's origins in mental health struggles and emotional vulnerability are being diluted as it becomes more mainstream.\n\n2.2.2.\n To-yoko kids(ﾄｰ横ｷｯｽﾞ) with Jirai Kei\n\nNext to the Toho Building in Kabukicho, there are often many young people gathered alone, wandering outside. Most of them are between 12 and 19 years old, having chosen to run away from home due to conflicts with their parents. Their numbers are so large that it has become a social phenomenon, and they are referred to by a specific term: \"To-yoko kids\" (ﾄｰ横ｷｯｽﾞ). \n\nMany of these To-yoko kids are minors who have not completed their education and lack the skills to make a living, making it difficult for them to participate in regular work. To cover daily expenses, many young women turn to \"sugar dating\" (ﾊﾟﾊﾟ活 ) relationships to earn money. Some girls choose to wear \"Jirai Kei\" fashion. This cute style not only enhances their physical attractiveness but also helps them quickly become the part of To-yoko kids community.\n\nMany people living here have no time to plan for the future, and they can only drift through the red-light district. The culture of the red-light district subtly influences their habits. Many To-yoko kids have unhealthy practices such as drug overdose, self-harm, and prostitution [9]. These behaviors serve as desperate ways for them to cope with the harsh realities they face.\n\nIt can be said that the To-yoko kids are the group that most closely aligns with the original definition of \"Jirai Onna\" today, and their expressions of it have become even more extreme. This phenomenon reflects structural deficiencies in Japanese society regarding youth protection and educational support.\n\n2.3.\n The development of Jirai Kei culture in China \n\nThe introduction of \"Jirai Kei\" to China occurred later than its emergence in Japan. Initially, it spread through anime and music, becoming integrated with otaku culture. In the early Chinese internet context, \"Jirai Kei\" did not carry a negative connotation but was instead seen as a \"cute\" associated with anime characters. The dangerous and emotionally unstable aspects of \"Jirai Onna\" were downplayed, transforming the image into one of a cute, well-dressed girl.\n\n A cute example is \"Menherachan\", a character who gained popularity on Bilibili in 2018. Another example closer to the original meaning of \"Jirai Onna\" is the VOCALOID song \"Venom\" (ﾍﾞﾉﾑ), released the same year. These two distinct perceptions of Jirai Kei culture became recognized as part of “otaku culture” in China, though they had not yet fully entered the mainstream internet lexicon. \n\nThe turning point for the development of \"Jirai Kei\" in China came after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019. Compared to the past, the pandemic lockdowns brought greater mental stress, forcing the younger generation to spend more time online.\n\nIn 2022, the release of the game “NEEDY GIRL OVERDOSE” further propelled the spread of the \"Jirai Onna\" label in China, as the game's protagonist embodied the typical appearance and mental state of a \"Jirai Onna.\" To cope with the pressures of daily life and seek emotional satisfaction and freedom, netizens began to freely create symbols and mock any form of rigidity [10][11]. Despite knowing that \"Jirai Onna\" originally carried a derogatory meaning, many people adopted self-deprecating humor to embrace and role-play as \"Jirai Onna,\" using it as a way to accept their unchangeable reality and gain a sense of belonging online [12], forming new interest-based communities. In China, these communities are primarily rooted in social platforms with a majority female user base, such as Redbook and Weibo. \n\n2.4.\n Similarities and differences between Chinese and Japanese Jirai Kei culture \n\nJapan's \"Jirai Kei\" culture started as a way to categorize real-life individuals or groups, reflecting societal realities. Essentially, it evolved from offline to online but never fully detached from its red-light district roots. This connection means the culture not only emerged from the red-light district but also draws those who identify as \"Jirai Onna\" or \"Jirai Otoko\" back into that environment.\n\nIn China, \"Jirai Kei\" culture began online and has since taken root in major social media platforms, forming virtual communities without physical gathering spaces. Unlike in Japan, Chinese enthusiasts focus less on internal struggles and more on their social media appearance, striving to match the standard Japanese \"Jirai Onna\" aesthetic. In anonymous forums, criticism often targets photos for having a \"China style\" (中味), citing issues like body shape, light makeup, or skin tone that deviate from the traditional \"Jirai Onna\" look. A brand hierarchy has also emerged, with Japanese labels favored over local ones, despite their higher cost.\n\nWhile Japanese \"Jirai Onna\" culture initially aimed to attract male attention and build relationships, its Chinese counterpart has blended with radical feminist ideas. Many Chinese \"Jirai Onna\" reject men entirely, criticizing them solely for their gender, even if they show interest in the culture. As a result, men are often excluded from participating or speaking in these communities.\n\n3.\n Conclusion\n\nDespite the many differences between Chinese and Japanese Jirai Kei cultures, there is one key similarity: just as Jirai Kei culture is gaining popularity in China, its prominence in Japan has also been rising in recent years. The resurgence of Jirai Kei culture symbolizes a shared societal pressure in both countries—unhappy family environments and overly competitive, \"involutionary\" social systems have forced young people, who feel unable to participate in this competition, to choose a path of rebellion. Through social media, ordinary people are exposed to a broader world and more possibilities, but the stark contrast between the idealized hologram of happiness online and the harsh realities of life creates a sense of helpless disconnection. Identifying with pre-modern subcultures may be a way to seek security and escape reality.\n\nWe need more unbiased understanding to clarify the root causes of these phenomena. It is hoped that future research will provide opportunities to delve deeper into the lives of Jirai Kei communities in both China and Japan, exploring how cultural dissemination operates and how geographical, economic, and political factors have shaped the same external culture into different core identities.\n\nReferences\n\n[1].

That’d be incredibly inappropriate for me to do, as I don’t know any of them well enough to know if they are a part of the jirai kei subculture. I am simply listing vtubers who seem to be the most popular within the ryousanjirai crowd, that is those whose female fanbase seems to have a higher proportion of ryousanjirai girls than most. \nThe other thing I’d like to get out of the way is that some vtubers on this list are known for using “menhera” as an insult. Sadly, thats grown popular in the vtuber scene and online spaces in japan. For vtuber fans reading this who think that’s a weird thing to say, the word “menhera” has been around since 2001 and was the name given to an internet subculture revolving around mental health safe spaces, awareness, and vent art. Even tho it was literally created to help erase the “mental illness makes you dangerous” thing, the stigma took over once the term went mainstream, so its often used to mean “yandere psycho”. The subculture still exists if you know where to look, but barely ever uses the name it gave itself anymore because it attracts trolls, edgelords, and fetishists.\nOne last thing- a few of these girls fit the “loli” archetype, and consider it a part of their appeal, but no minors will be featured on this list.\nabsolutely zero past-life discussion\nI’ll do my best to summarize what the vtuber is known for and the reasons i think are likely why their female fanbase has a larger proportion of ryousanjirai girls. \n1. Sakamata Chloe (Hololive HoloX)\nGiven that she recently got a new outfit that looks a lot like a dark girly kei coord, you’ve probably seen Chloe on your feed recently. Despite her yamikawaii punk-ish look, she’s so cute and probably couldn’t survive in the wild if she were a real orca. The “pon” is unreal. Her original songs talk about her own inner pain in a way that may be relatable to jirai girls, and she’s covered a lot of songs popular with us too (such as Cute Loving and Devil Janai Mon). Between her cutesiness, choice in fashion, and her songs, it’s easy to see why she’s loved by jirai kei girls.\n2. Minato Aqua (Hololive Gen. 2)\nYou probably know about Aqua if you follow me, since I just posted a link to one of her more recent song covers. It’s one about a ryousangata girl falling in love with a host, and knowing his affection is fake but wanting it anyway. She covers a lot of songs about topics that are familiar to ryousan and jirai girls, like kyuukurarin, darling dance, goodbye declaration, and internet overdose to name a few. Her original songs are also hits with the ryousangata crowd, with “aqua iro palette” being the choice of song in so many tiktoks and reels of ryousan wotas showing off their lavish birthday celebrations for their oshis. She’s also a cosplayer, frequently wearing maid outfits, making her relatable to a lot of girls who work at concept cafes. She also did a duet with Shion, a cover of “menhera janai mon”, which is a song i often see misinterpreted outside of japan because of the need for cultural context on jirai kei, ryousangata, and menhera both as a subculture and insult. Should I do a post explaining the lyrics and overall themes? \n3. Makaino Ririmu (Nijisanji Gamers Generation 3)\nListen. If you’re in the jirai kei subculture, I guarantee you’ve seen Ririmu. This girl’s fanart is probably on every jirai kei blog known to man. If you don’t recognize this model, you’d recognize the maid outfit with bondage elements thats paired with a coat that looks suspiciously like REFLEM’s bunny ears coat (the one that took yamikawa lovers by storm a while back). Ririmu’s popularity with jirai kei girls isn’t just because she likes similar fashions to most of us. Ririmu has been open about her past suffering with agorophobia, suicidal ideation, and being a NEET. She’s shared bits and pieces of her recovery with her fans! Of course, she also does yandere bit that might be more than a bit, and covers a lot of songs popular with ryousan and jirai girls, like more kyun, chuupuri, and vampire.\n4. Mikeneko (Indie)\nMikeneko isn’t new to the scene at all, but has recently come out of a partly mental health related hiatus to a much larger following than before. Mikeneko collects models like they’re pokemon cards, going thru four in total now, two of which have been in one year. She wears tons of yamikawa fashions, and plays up her chuunibyou for streams. Aside from her on-and-off NEETdom, Mikeneko is open about a lot of her health issues, including bipolar, and about her medication and trips to the psychiatric hospital. She calls herself menhera, often in the secondary meaning, but she’s also rumored to have been a part of the actual subculture for a long time. Her original songs, drop and you&me ring really true for a lot of jirai and menhera girls such as myself.\n5. Meloco Kyoran (Nijisanji EN Generation 7)\nMeloco is the only vtuber on this list to be a part of an company’s EN (english-speaking) branch. She’s included on the list because she’s also big in japan- because she’s japanese. She’s almost fluent in english and was accepted for the english branch, but frequently slips into japanese and appeals to her japanese fans. Her outfit is gothic lolita inspired with bondage elements and plenty of edge, to fit her overall spooky exorcist theming. Her creepy-cute nature and cool alternative onee-san demeanor have attracted her many jirai kei fans, and inspired a lot of ryousan girls’ oshi nails.\n6. Sukoya Kana (Nijisanji Tulip-gumi Unit)\nAdmittedly, Kana’s probably got more menhera (as in the subculture) fans than jirai or ryousan, but she still has enough that I wanted to include her. Her nurse theming isn’t just a gimmick, her actual “day job” is as a nurse. As in, when she’s not streaming, she works in a hospital as staff after passing her qualifying exams in 2022! She must be super busy! Her morbid interests and fetishes, as well as her medical themed design, have no doubt appealed to many jirai girls too. Besides that, she’s covered a lot of songs, including quite a few beloved by landmines such as lavie, nainai girls pride, and godish.\n7. Natori Sana (Indie)\nListen, I just know you’ve seen her figures by now. Every menhera, yamikawaii, and “cutecore” account in the west has at least one of this nurse girl’s figures. She’s ultra cute, with a sickeningly sweet smile and design. Her lore is interesting- she claims to work at a sanitarium, but has hinted very heavily many times that she is in fact not a nurse, but a patient in denial. Whether this is just lore for fun and appeal or is a dramatized reflection of Sana’s own feelings and mental health is up for speculation.\n8. La+ (Laplus) Darkness (HoloX)\nRemember that disclaimer regarding using menhera derogatorily earlier? Yeah that’s 90% because of Laplus’s inclusion on the list. It feels like she accuses someone of being menhera (derogatory) like every other VOD. Apart from that, Laplus is a grade A kusogaki, complete with constant angry outburst when things don’t go her way. She’s a demon whos intelligence was… “sealed away”… sure. Her gothic appearance and explosive personality seem to be what’s gained her such a large jirai kei following.\n9. Houshou Marine (Hololive Gen. 3)\nDear god. Alright, so you’ve definitely heard at least two of her songs if you’re on japanese jirai kei SNS at all. This cosplaying pirate is so horny that it’s literally considered her catchphrase. Her original songs about wanting to be seen as desirable and be… pleasured seem to be especially popular with landmine girls (which is maybe related to how many jirai girls are in a certain profession). She enjoys gothic lolita fashion, girls love/yuri, and enough fetishes to lose track of if you’re counting. \n10. Shigure Ui (Indie)\nDid you really think I could make this list without including hololive star Oozora Subaru’s mom and voice of the song that’s plaguing japanese social media, ESPECIALLY landmine social media rn? Sure, it’s everywhere, but go check every insta kaiwai dedicated to jirai subculture and see how many of their reels have this song. Even though she’s just now broken out to this degree of fame, she’s been around a while, and is the “mama” (artist) to several other vtubers. She often collabs with hololive members! She loves taboo fiction, which is also especially popular amongst jirai girls.\nLast but not least, I want to add three honorable mentions from Hololive that are also popular with ryousanjirai girls. Tokoyami Towa is a super popular choice of cosplay amongst jirai girls specifically. She has a cute-but-cool look, and lots of her outfits definitely have subcultural influences from japanese ゴスパンク (gothic x punk) and general “egirl”-type styles. Murasaki Shion is a very popular choice of profile pic for ryousanjirai girls, and it’s easy to see why. Her “kusogaki” appeal and lolita outfits, as well as her “Menhera Janai Mon” duet with Aqua all appeal to that demographic. Finally, last honorable mention is Amane Kanata, purely because of how popular she is with lovers of Tenshi Kaiwai, which has a lot of overlap with the jirai subculture. She basically predicted the trend before the magazine that popularized it even existed. Mizuiro x white cybercore outfits, a nurse cosplay, and angel theming make her a spot-on icon in that scene.\nThat’s it! Now I have to stop procrastinating on the pien kei characters post…\n\n \n\n \n \n64 notes\n\nalternativelis\n liked this \ngivemeyourfaceplzzz\n liked this \nfeargardenz\n liked this \nporcelanitaa\n liked this \nbonehalos\n liked this \ndigital-angelz\n liked this \np1nkmedusa\n liked this \nhimenako\n liked this \nzitds\n liked this \njiraiyui\n liked this \n3xistent14lcrisis\n liked this \ncarrotflowerboy\n liked this \ncandyebun\n liked this \nditzypudding\n liked this \ndinight866\n reblogged this from \npienhime\n \nkeyqu1455\n liked this \noracleofdykey\n liked this \novertnihilist\n liked this \nsemisweet-heart\n reblogged this from \npienhime\n \nsemisweet-heart\n liked this \nrosenlita\n liked this \npoorpastel-pain\n liked this \ncottoncandydreamsandlace\n liked this \ntetsudouprincess\n liked this \npersocons\n liked this \njirai-girl\n liked this \nddrexpert\n liked this \narsonistman\n liked this \nchacharcherry\n liked this \ntorashii-tk\n liked this \npastel-mo0n\n liked this \ngonathanwithag\n liked this \nmari-wa-landmine\n liked this \nyustandforrain\n liked this \nwriting-bella\n liked this \ndoll-lesbian\n liked this \nkanon-byrnhildr\n liked this \npixistix-and-poprox\n liked this \nchesheyer\n liked this \npienhime\n posted this \n\n Two important things to know before you read any further: I am NOT alleging any of these vtubers to be jirai kei.

So I've come across the term landmine or mine woman when looking through \nwear.jp\n today (I'm a fan of Japanese fashions). It was a tag on someone's outfit, so I clicked it and girly and goth style coords popped up. I also saw the term several weeks ago when looking at Japanese makeup videos (the girl was going a dark girly style of makeup). What exactly does this term mean? When I googled 地雷女 a bunch of dating advice articles popped up saying this is the type of woman to avoid. But it seems like an extreme stereotype and not an actual personality type. Also, girls seem to be labeling themselves/ their style with this term, but I'm not sure if they're doing it unironically or not. Is this term just a joke or is it kind of insulting (like otaku)?\n \n\n Note: I don't know how to read katakana or hiragana, I just use google translate when searching things in Japanese.\n \n\n Read more\n \n \n\n \n\n Archived post.

It is primarily associated with young people frequenting the nightlife of Kabukichō. Initially, the style closely resembled the darker variant of \nJapanese Girly\n fashion during its peak popularity, but it has since evolved to incorporate a wider range of styles.\n\nThe subculture carries a stereotype: young women who adopt this cute, hyperfeminine yet dark fashion are perceived to have personalities that contradict their appearance. Instead of being sweet and demure, they are often stereotyped as violent and obsessive (akin to a \nYandere\n), engaging in self-harm, and having habits of heavy drinking or smoking.\n\nJapanese brands have rapidly adapted to this trend, with Western brands influenced by Kawaii culture also following suit.\n\nContents\n\n1\n \nHistory\n\n2\n \nVisuals\n\n3\n \nFashion\n\n3.1\n \nTops\n\n3.2\n \nBottoms\n\n3.3\n \nShoes and Legwear\n\n3.4\n \nAccessories\n\n3.5\n \nHair and Makeup\n\n4\n \nMedia\n\n4.1\n \nLiterature\n\n4.2\n \nManga\n\n4.3\n \nTelevision\n\n4.4\n \nVideo Games\n\n5\n \nMusic\n\n5.1\n \nSongs\n\n5.2\n \nPlaylists\n\n6\n \nCriticism\n\n7\n \nResources\n\n7.1\n \nBlogs\n\n7.2\n \nVendors\n\n8\n \nGallery\n\n9\n \nReferences\n\n10\n \nNavigation\n\nHistory\n[\n]\n\nThe term \"Jirai Kei\" is derived from \"\nJirai Onna\n\" (地雷女), literally \"landmine woman,\" a derogatory term used to stereotype women, particularly those with mental illnesses such as Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), bipolar disorder, and other mood swing-inducing conditions, as a \"ticking time bomb.\" This term is often employed to dismiss women, frequently ex-girlfriends, as \"crazy\" or \"dangerous\" based on arbitrary traits, such as an affinity for kawaii aesthetics. Within the subculture, women are referred to as \"\nJirai Joshi\n\" (地雷女子), or \"landmine girls,\" while men are called \"\nJirai Danshi\n\" (地雷男子), or \"landmine boys.\"\n\nThe subculture became associated with various darker fashion styles following a \"psycho girlfriend\" dress-up challenge that gained viral traction during the March 2020 COVID-19 restrictions in Japan.\n[\n1\n]\n This challenge frequently referenced traits commonly associated with the Toyoko Kids, a group primarily composed of young runaway teenagers, some of whom were groomed online by older men with promises of a better life in the Kabukicho red-light district. These individuals are often exploited for sex work, drug trafficking, and other criminal activities.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\n\nWhile Western followers of Jirai Kei often attempt to separate it from its darker origins by viewing it solely as a fashion trend, the subculture largely retains a negative public image within Japan. Its associations with the \"psycho girlfriend\" trope are interpreted as a misogynistic stereotype, yet Japanese girls who identify as \"landmine\" fully embrace it.\n[\n4\n]\n This misunderstanding stems from several factors: the language barrier hindering accurate interpretation of Japanese articles and social media posts, a lack of awareness regarding the perception of mental health issues in Japan, and brands capitalizing on the subculture's popularity by using \"Jirai Kei\" as a marketing term, regardless of whether their products are genuinely associated with it.\n\nVisuals\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExample of a heavily edited selfie by @hiudayonn.\n \n \n\nGirls in this subculture add \nheavy filters and edits\n to their photos. Pale pink and white filters can add a slight haze to all of their images, and they are often decorated in \nvirtual stickers\n with Jirai Kei motifs. They also use \nface and body editing\n to the point of an unnatural appearance. Impossibly large eyes with anime proportions, making skin more pale, and making their bodies thinner and longer are extremely common in photos. This is with the goal of appearing eerie and puppy-eyed, diverging from the trend of \"pien\" makeup on Japanese tiktok. The color palettes of Jirai Kei is mainly white, black and pastel pink, though on occasion red, blue and grey is also used. \n\nTo contrast all of the sweet and girly visuals, violent imagery is often shown. \nBox-cutters, razors, and pockets knives\n are commonly featured in outfit posts. The stereotype is that a landmine girl would use it to threaten her boyfriend if he upsets her, or that she engages in self-harm. Additionally, these cute girls often pose with \nfake guns\n (firearms are illegal in Japan), cigarettes, or \nalcohol and energy drinks\n (from Strong Zero and Monster Energy) with straws, presumably to protect their lipstick while drinking. Many photos have color-scheme matching energy drink cans, and it is even popular to stack and glue the cans in the shape of machine guns. Similar to Yami Kawaii, there is often medical imagery of \npills and syringes\n, usually paired with narcotics and synthetic drugs. \n\nSanrio is strongly associated with the \nKawaii\n, girly, and consumer culture in Japan. As a result, girls into Jirai Kei are also associated with these characters, specifically \nKuromi\n and My Melody\n. People in this subculture own and take photos of plushies of these characters and own an assortment of merchandise, such as backpacks, pencil pouches, etc. themed around these characters. Sanrio has taken notice and even released Jirai Kei-inspired plushies of Kuromi and My Melody. Another character that can be associated is Menhera-chan, the suicidal magical girl that popularized \nYami Kawaii\n. Her artist has drawn her in stereotypical outfits, and her self-destructive habits could be relatable for those in the subculture. \n\nThere's also many artists engaging with the subculture who draw \nanime-style illustrations\n of landmine girls wearing the typical outfits while in stereotypical situations, such as taking selfies, holding a can while squatting on the streets, or having a mental breakdown. Jirai Kei followers often repost these \ndrawings on social media\n. \n\nFashion\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe various styles worn by jirai girls illustrated featuring Blue Archive characters. \n \n \n\nThe styles associated with Jirai Kei are constantly changing with the core defining trait being that the fashion is worn by landmine girls. Comparable to \nE-Girl\n’s style, while landmine girls may wear many different fashion styles, there is a main look typically associated with the aesthetic that evolved out of a mix of several different alternative genres. The initial look associated with the Jirai Kei subculture derived from \nJapanese Girly fashion\n and \nYami Kawaii\n, however outfits consisting out of \nGoth Punk\n, \nJersey Maid\n, and darker general \nalternative\n fashion have also been popular among its followers. As the trends within Jirai Kei keep on changing, many brands mimic one another and release mix-and-match variations for the various styles worn. The fabric of the clothes tends to be on the more synthetic side, with the quality not being that high, on account of them often being made by fast fashion companies who constantly adopt to the latest trends. \n\nRegardless of the style worn, the idea is to appear cute yet mature, but with an dark aura. \n\nThe ultra-feminine Jirai style has also evolved since its inception. As the style developed, the details of the style increased, with certain trends being more or less popular as certain garments from specific brands became viral. \n\nTops\n[\n]\n\nThe most common tops are \nblouses with ultra-feminine details\n that may slightly resemble \nLolita Fashion.\n Peter Pan and sailor collars, ruffles, lace trim, puffed sleeves, cold-shoulders, contrasting buttons are some tropes that are featured in the blouses. Alternative outfits use coat-dresses instead, and winter outfits utilize knit sweaters. Girls also often \ntie ribbons or add bow brooches with rhinestone or pearl-accented faux jewels\n at the neck. \n\nSome brands have also released \noversized tees and sweatshirts\n that can fit in with this aesthetic. They often have a print with a stereotypical motif, English text, anime prints, etc. These also contain feminine details, but less often. For example, there may be eyelets for lacing ribbon through, zippers, or detachable Peter Pan collars. This resembles the fashion of the \nYami Kawaii\n aesthetic, and contributes to an edgier and less girly look. Jirai boys add masculine or androgynous elements to this style, while girls like to pair these tops with chunky sneakers and necklaces. \n\nA trend that appeared approximately 2023 is the set-up, which is a two-piece set consisting of a \ntunic-length top with a matching pair of micro-shorts\n, with the aim of it looking like an extra-short dress, with the shorts being for modesty purposes. This top would have the same details as the blouses. \n\nBottoms\n[\n]\n\nHigh waisted mini skirts\n are by far the most popular bottom. The silhouette can be flared, trapezoid or pleated. \nSilver hardware details\n such as heart-shaped belt buckles, eyelets, and zippers add edge to the outfit and contrast the lace and girly details of the blouse. But there are also ruffles, ribbon lacing to resemble a corset, and ruffled suspenders to add girliness. \nShorts\n can also be featured in this aesthetic, as well as \nlonger flowy skirts\n. However, they are both comparatively rare to the mini skirts. Usually the bottoms are black while the top is pink or white, though sometimes this is flipped. \n\nThe more casual \nJersey Maid\n and \nYami Kawaii\n inspired looks can also have \ntrack pants\n like ones from Adidas as a pairing with a track suit jacket or oversized tee or sweatshirt. \n\nShoes and Legwear\n[\n]\n\nBecause the legs are most often exposed in this style, \nlace or fishnet stockings\n are worn, and could be switched or even doubled up with \nruffled or lace ankle socks\n. \n\nThe shoes are most commonly \nplatform loafers or multi-strapped mary janes\n, and most girls buy their shoes from BUBBLES Tokyo, DearMyLove, Liz Lisa and others. The shoes can be \nmore decorated,\n with faux jewels, ribbon laces, rhinestone buckles and silver cross charms. \n\nAccessories\n[\n]\n\nThe most popular bags are \ntotes and mini backpacks\n. Usually, they're pink or black, sometimes adorned with ribbons and bows with plushies or Sanrio figurine keychains attached. The most popular mini backpacks on social media are the studded MCM mini packpack and Melody Maison de Fleur totes. Other girls may instead use bags from \npopular luxury brands\n.\n\nAside from ribbons and bows, there is not much jewelry involved in Jirai Kei. Most styles include only earrings or neckwear like chokers, piercings and necklaces. A popular trend is the Viviene Westwood orb necklace. Because of the color scheme, many girls avoid gold jewelry and opt for silver.\n\nHair and Makeup\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAn illustration of the typical hairstyles by \nAkagumi-chan\n.\n \n \n\nHime-cut bangs,\n which are straight bangs across the forehead with side bangs around chin-length, are extremely popular amongst young women in Japan in general as it is an easy way to archive the illusion of a small face. It fits in with the ultra-feminine style. Because these women are Japanese and around high school age, the \nmost common hair color is black\n, since dyed hair is not allowed in schools. However, some girls add \nhighlights that can be bleached blonde or in different shades of pink.\n\nIn terms of styling, \npigtails\n (also called twin tails), are the majority hairstyle. They can be either low or high, with high pigtails often being \nhalf-up half-down\n. Girls often curl the ends and decorate these twin tails with \nribbons and bows\n, often with the same faux jewels on their brooches. Other \nhair accessories\n such as rectangle headdresses, headbands with faux jewels, and bobby pins with charms are popular too. \n\nFor the eye makeup, the most popular is an exaggerated version of the \"\nnamida bukuro\n\" makeup style where the \ntear bags\n are emphasized to look puffy as if the wearer is about to cry, which is further highlighted with pink undereye blush. The additional effect of appearing sickly is also desired. The \neyeliner is downturned to give a more \"puppy-like\"\n , feminine and sad appearance. \n\nFace and lip makeup are equally pink, with \nblush and sparkly highlighter being high\n on the cheekbones. \nLip makeup has a wide variation\n, with some looks being more matte, some glossy, some sculpted, some even. \n\nMany additional cosmetic products are also used for exaggerated features. \nFake lashes\n are generally popular in Japan, and in Jirai Kei, they are longer and spikier. \nDark circle lenses\n are also popular, and serve to make the eyes look bigger and anime-like. \n\nLong acrylic nails\n are also popular and often feature lace patterns, faux jewels, corset lacing, crosses, as well as stereotypical motifs like the pleading face emoji. \n\nMedia\n[\n]\n\nLiterature\n[\n]\n\nHost Madness\n - Oizumi Rika\n\nKabukicho Moratorium\n - Chiwawa Sasaki\n\nPeople Who Overdose\n - Chiwawa Sasaki\n\nThe Disease of Pien: Consumption and Approval of the SNS Generation\n - Chiwawa Sasaki\n\nManga\n[\n]\n\nAshita, Watashi wa Dareka no Kanojo - Tomorrow, I'll Be Someone's Girlfriend\n\nAndroid wa Jirai-kei no Yume wo Miru - Android Dreams of a Jirai Kei Girl\n\nKiken na Ren'ai - Dangerous Love\n\nKimi ni Aisarete Itakatta - It Hurts To Be Loved By You\n\nJirai Kareshi - My Boyfriend's a Ticking Time Bomb\n\nJirai-kei JK to Onee-chan no Hanashi - The Landmine Girl and Her Sister\n\nJirai Ninja Ruru no Shitsuren - Jirai Ninja Ruru's Heartbreak\n\nKakaKano - Dating the Kind of Girl You Shouldn't Get Involved With\n\nKoi wa Jirai wo Funde kara - A Love That Begins After Stepping On A Mine\n\nMitame Jirai-kei Osananajimi - My Childhood Friend Looks Like A Landmine But Isn't\n\nYamaarashi no Shisha (ヤマアラシのシーシャ)\n\nZenma (銭麻)\n\nTelevision\n[\n]\n\nAshita, Watashi wa Dareka no Kanojo\n\nCinderella Complex\n\nIshiko and Haneo: You're Suing Me?\n (episode 7)\n\nThe Black Swindler (episode 8)\n\nVideo Games\n[\n]\n\nJIRAIYA\n\nNeedy Streamer Overload\n\nSentimental Deathloop\n\nSuteki na Kanojo no Tsukurikata\n\nYandere ura Kano Jirai-chan\n\nYamikore\n\nLove Angel Syndrome\n\nMusic\n[\n]\n\nSongs\n[\n]\n\nAlice*Iris - Daikirai Lie Suki\n\nAlice*Iris - Gimme Me Love\n\nAmu - Pien Syndrome\n\nAmu - Mekka Warning\n\nCagayake - Unleash\n\nChilldspot - Ai Ai\n\nDECO*27 - The Vampire\n\nIsana - Menhera Janai Mon!\n\nHoneyWorks - Kawaikute Gomen\n\nKuraisekai - So Pien My Life\n\nKAFU - Egonomy\n\nKai - Unicorn Girl\n\nKai - Lose the Princess\n\nKairiki Bear - Darling Dance\n\nKareki Kashiwagi - Ikayaki-Wristed Girl\n\nLiLiPi - Shukipi Overdose\n\nMagnetite Hiiragi feat.

There are strong associations with mental illness, self harm, drug usage, sex work, underage prostitution, and other uncomfortable subjects. The negative aspects of the \"landmine\" stereotype are often emulated and romanticized as a quirky gimmick solely for aesthetic reasons.\n[\n5\n]\n On Twitter in particular, it's not uncommon for followers of the subculture to constantly promote self-destructive behaviour, the accounts often being part of \nshtwt\n (self-harm twitter) and \nedtwt\n (eating disorder twitter).\n[\n4\n]\n There's also a strong association with \"bangya\" culture with landmine girls also being stereotyped as groupies who are obsessive over their favorite bands and music artists to an unhealthy degree.\n\nAnother problem is the fetishization of the \"landmine\" stereotype, which is a glimpse into the wider topic of sexualizing women who exhibit mental illness. It is problematic for its ableist rhetoric claiming mentally-ill women to be \"freaky\", \"hot but crazy\" and more desirable sexually and emotionally, as well as its infantalistic undertone of these women being more emotionally attached and dependent on their lover's affection.\n[\n6\n]\n This fetishization of mentally ill women and use of the femme-fatale archetype ignores the unpleasant nuances of suffering from BPD or bipolar disorder and targets women who are mentally vulnerable to emotionally abusive, power-imbalanced relationships.\n[\n7\n]\n\nThere also have been issues caused by the strong associations with the host culture of Kabukicho. As people of any age can enter those establishments as long as no alcohol is served, male hosts have been actively going for young girls to spend money on them in exchange for affection, often resulting in the girls resorting to \"papa katsu\" (sugar-daddying) in order to afford their host club addiction.\n[\n8\n]\n\nBecause the clothes worn are often very brand specific, some Jirai Kei netizens suggest that there is slight elitism in the community for purchasing items from the \"correct\" stores, regardless of if the price can be prohibitively expensive, particularly for western followers that endure high shipping fees from Japanese brand proxies. On social media, especially on TikTok, some argue that this brand-focused side of Jirai Kei encourages hyper consumerism and trend-cycling while the same is also said for those who buy cheap replica items from problematic fast fashion stores like Shein/Romwe. \n\nAs the subculture can't be separated from its problematic parts precisely because they are what make Jirai Kei what it is, many have argued that its name shouldn't be used in a throwaway manner in reference to styles or trends in order to not expose strangers to potential triggering content. \n\nResources\n[\n]\n\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\nFor further reading, please read its \npage\n on the Jfashion Wiki. \n\nBlogs\n[\n]\n\nZirai Bijyo\n\nSubcul Zirai\n\nZirai Zyoshi\n\nVendors\n[\n]\n\nAnk Rouge\n\nAmilige\n\nBubbles\n\nDarrdy\n\nDearMyLove\n\nLafary\n\nLIZ LISA\n\nMA*RS\n\nNoemie\n\nReflem\n\nRojita\n\nSubcul Zirai\n\nTravas Tokyo\n\nViviene Westwood\n\nYosuke USA\n\nGallery\n[\n]\n\nキャンメイク縛り地雷メイク【イエベ・茶髪OK】\nA makeup tutorial\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n↑\n \nAbsolutely the largest eyes!!

As \"landmine\" is almost always used in negative context towards a person and to harass or demean, there has been controversy surrounding the name.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\n While the term has seen some use in Japanese media as a sales point, it is still seen as derogatory to the degree that the staff of various companies refuse to work on anything related to the term or trend.\n[\n6\n]\n\nWomen within the subculture are called \"Jirai Joshi\" (地雷女子), or landmine girls, while men in the subculture are referred to as \"Jirai Danshi\" (地雷男子), or landmine boys.\n\nOrigins and Controversy\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nDue to a makeup challenge by Japanese YouTuber SuReRo\n[\n7\n]\n that went viral during the March 2020 corona restrictions in Japan, which was about emulating the \"landmine woman\" stereotype, the term has been associated with various darker styles, gradually morphing into its own subculture.\n[\n8\n]\n\nJirai Kei has strong associations with some darker or disturbing themes, though not in the style on its own like \nYami Kawaii\n. In this case, Jirai Kei may be associated with self-harm, drug abuse, alcoholism, street partying, illegal sex work, and other rebellious and shocking behaviors. The associations of this kind of behavior with Jirai Kei is said to have its roots among the Toyoko Kids - a criminal gang mainly consisting out of teenage runaways that is active in Kabukicho, furthering its negative connotations.\n[\n9\n]\n Many criticize that Jirai Kei has contributed to harmful real life consequences, such as teens and young adults being groomed into self-destructive behavior in order to get accepted within the subculture.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\n\nThere's also arguments to be made for the supposed appropriation of the \"landmine\" stereotype by both Japanese and overseas followers of Jirai Kei as solely a fashion trend. Elements commonly associated with the stereotype are often emulated and romanticized as a quirky gimmick solely for aesthetic reasons.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n13\n]\n Meanwhile, those who engage in substance usage, self-harm, and sex work face criticism and demonization from others into Jirai Kei, especially overseas netizens, who wish to renounce them after accusations of Jirai Kei promoting problematic behavior by outsiders.\n[\n14\n]\n In response, some contend that Jirai Kei followers who engage in problematic behavior, labeled as \"lifestyle landmines\", are the true originators of the subculture and therefore should not be disowned from the community solely for the sake of maintaining the reputation of those who insist on only participating in the associated aesthetics of the subculture, labeled as \"fashion landmines\".\n\nDue to the controversies related to the Jirai Kei subculture, people both within Japan as well overseas have stated that it should be no longer promoted in reference to styles and trends as its the fashion part is already mostly encompassed in \nDark Girly\n and \nYami Kawaii.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n15\n]\n\nStyle Basics\n[\n]\n\nJirai Kei as a style has a strong focus on the overall styling rather than the clothes on their own, and therefore the fashions worn can vary to a high degree depending on the current common trends within the subculture.\n\nClothes\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStyles commonly worn by Jirai girls over the years.\n \n \nSince the initial boom in 2020, Jirai Kei has expanded into multiple directions and now covers a wide range of styles. The classic Jirai Kei outfit features \nGirly\n fashion and emphasizes a feminine yet mysterious aura with a focus on the color combination of black with muted pink, but occasionally also red or white.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n16\n]\n High collared blouses are being worn with a frilly high waist skirt and the clothes are often accented with lace and frills.\n[\n1\n]\n An alternative winter version of the style swaps the frilly blouse with a lacey sweater. Gemstone jewelry often includes rhinestones and pearls. Some of the most popular platform shoe choices are platform loafers and, more commonly, Mary Jane platform clogs (both are usually chosen from around 3 inches to 5 inches of back heel length). Lace trim socks or dark tights are be worn under the shoes.\n\nAs the initial look associated with Jirai Kei became mainstream, it started to move on to edgier alternative fashion looks.\n[\n3\n]\n The outfits of this type are generally unisex and often incorporate oversized \nYami Kawaii\n tops with their typical prints, the most popular being depictions of sick or injured stuffed animals, that are worn like a dress and reach a little below the thigh area. There's also many \nGoth Punk\n elements with ripped sweaters, bondage elements, fishnet tights, and massive platform shoes.\n[\n17\n]\n Tracksuits are also occasionally worn in combination with leg warmers or loose socks. Black is still in the central focus for the clothes but with vibrant colors such as red, blue, or purple, as accents. \n\nHair and Makeup\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nTypical \"namida bukuro\" makeup.\n \n \n\nJirai Kei makeup often resembles a highly exaggerated version of byojaku makeup with the typical pink or red under eye blush, emphasized tear bags, down-turned black eyeliner, and overall pale makeup foundation. Black circle lens contacts are commonly worn to make the eyes appear bigger, lipstick colors can vary based on how the wearer decides.\n[\n1\n]\n\nFor hairstyles, hime cut bangs, twin-tails with the ends curled (also referred to as pigtails), and black hair with highlights are most common, though many Japanese Jirai girls also dye strands of their hair to a darker pink color, or use colored extensions. Cute nail art (black and white being the most common colors) with gems and 3D art are also usually seen, especially incorporating Sanrio themes.\n\nAccessories\n[\n]\n\nCommon accessories in Jirai Kei include long black satin hair bows, Miu Miu bracelets, variants of the saturn logo necklace from Vivienne Westwood, a Jill Stuart handbag or MCM logo backpack in pale pink, as well as various types of Sanrio character accessories, most often featuring the characters My Melody or Kuromi.\n[\n1\n]\n Miss Dior perfume bottles are also vastly popular and a common perfume choice. Older adult women invested in the fashion sense can also seen drinking various types of alcohol, like \"Strong Zero\" with a straw, presumably to not disturb their makeup.\n[\n13\n]\n\nAttitude\n[\n]\n\nOn top of the style standing out, Jirai Kei also has a unique attitude of wanting to be in charge, or pushing to be seen and recognized. This slightly rebellious attitude is often seen in those who wear the style; underage high school girls can be seen smoking, drinking, and wandering city streets at night as part of this behavior. It also has ties to even darker themes, such as public promotion of self harm and underage prostitution (see the above \nControversy\n section).\n\nPopularity\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nManga cover featuring Yua Takahashi from \"Tomorrow, I'll Be Someone's Girlfriend\" (明日、私は誰かのカノジョ)\n \n \n\nDespite Jirai Kei being a younger and controversial subculture, it has seen some rise in popularity. Particularly, it has been covered by online magazines who reported about celebrities taking part in the initial makeup challenge, as well as featured by Japanese influencers and beauty gurus who created makeup tutorials for archiving the various looks.\n[\n8\n]\n During the height of its popularity, Jirai Kei's initial style has also been worn by the popular Japanese model Tsubasa Masuwaka, and she described it as \"cute with a gothic edge\".\n[\n18\n]\n\nAlthough it hasn't gained much media traction overseas, Jirai Kei has been mentioned a bit in various English media.\n[\n8\n]\n There also has been a slight increase of general awareness about the subculture due to the drama adaption of the manga \"Tomorrow, I Will Be Someone's Girlfriend\" with the character \"Yua\" representing both the stereotype as well as the style. Music featuring Jirai Kei characters has also become popular in the mainstream, with songs such as DECO*27's \"The Vampire\" featuring Hatsune Miku dressing and acting as a landmine girl reaching nearly 70M views as of late 2023.\n[\n19\n]\n\nBrands & Shops\n[\n]\n\nAnk Rouge\n\nAmilige\n\nBubbles\n\nDarrdy\n\nDearMyLove\n\nLafary\n\nLiz Lisa\n\nMA*RS\n\nNoemie\n\nReflem\n\nRojita\n\nSubcul Zirai\n\nTravas Tokyo\n\nViviene Westwood\n\nYosuke USA\n\nGallery\n[\n]\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n↑ \n1.0\n \n1.1\n \n1.2\n \n1.3\n \n\"Appearing all over Kabukicho!

Welcome to This Side of Japan, a newsletter about Japanese music, new and old! \nYou can check out previous issues here\n.\nCW: Depression, mental health\nA casual browse at Japanese rock music in the 2010s might lead you to the descriptor \nmenhera—\na shorthand for the manic depressive among other behaviors related to poor mental health. A quick Google search of “\nmenhera \nrock” will return some blog posts going back to at least 2015, including \na playlist made in 2017 at streaming site KKBox\n compiling songs that fit in this would-be subgenre or another list from last year titled “\npopular \nmenhera\n songs for karaoke\n.”\nIt’s one thing to group sad songs to get over a break up as the latter list did, collecting songs by Kana Nishino, Ringo Shiina and Aimyon. Labeling the music with a loaded word like \nmenhera, \nhowever, is simply insensitive, if not disturbing in the way it flattens depression into a supposedly recognizable aesthetic. But trivializing mental illness in such a manner is a phenomenon perpetuated to this day in Japanese culture one way or another through bands like Milky Way—who frequently comes up in these \nmenhera\n rock lists—still using it as a hashtag for \ntheir new music\n or the recent viral meme of \njirai meiku\n—\na red-based make-up style to mimic the look of a \njirai jyoshi,\n or a girl who appears fine on the surface but actually unstable.\nThe ease in which \nmenhera\n is thrown partly has to do with the word’s origin as internet slang. First appearing in the 2010s, the term is a portmanteau of \nmentaru herusu\n, or mental health, added with the suffix of -er that was first used to refer to people perusing the mental health threads on 2chan, according to \nWeblio\n.\nThe term made its way into music early on that decade as well. Another popular rock band in these lists, Mio Yamazaki uploaded “\nMenhera\n” to YouTube in 2013, and the song illustrates the common sensibilities exhibited by those who get grouped as \nmenhera\n rock. The lyrical content is more emotionally frank, depressive, and aggressive compared to the average pop song. The verses ignore pop brevity and instead like to go on long-winded. The scrolling lyric video not only gets at how much the lyrics bleed over the margins but also how it resembles raw internet text, either on forums, IMs or iPhone conversations, thrown onto music. I imagine this is how an unlikely candidate like the acoustic-guitar-carrying Aimyon can get lumped into a list like this, through her Line-inspired music video for “\nAnatakaiboujyunaika ~Shine~\n”—or “The Dissection of You as a Love Song: Die.”\nIt’s unfortunate that these artists get grouped under such a crass category because their music itself is valuable in the way it taps into topics then not often found in mainstream pop. Not only do these artists not hold back from voicing emotions like depression, obsession and self-loathing, they present them as ugly and messy as they feel. The guitar riffs are often jagged, sometimes woven in complicated knots, while the singers don’t care if their voices are abrasive compared to the average pop singer. The misshapen qualities as well as their intensity only make the music feel more visceral and personal.\nWhile commonalities within in this type of music might emerge, establishing a subgenre for these works just creates more issues. Identifying these modes of expression as genre tropes flatten the perception of the music. Rounding the artists under a term such as \nmenhera\n only attaches stigma to not only the types of conversation they start but the methods in which they express those topics. It’s worth mentioning quite a few acts that people fit into this category are either women or voiced by women, who are also subjected to adjacent terms such as \njirai-onna\n and \nmenhera joshi\n more than men. “When I express sadness or anger, I’m told ‘ you’re \nmenhera\n,’ when I try to speak with logic, I’m told ‘that’s not cute,’” \nHaru Nemuri tweeted in 2018\n. Popularizing the describing of music as \nmenhera\n only creates more misogynistic ways to shut down art made by women.\nDuring the latter half of the decade, artists whose music get described as \nmenhera\n seems to have accepted just how vapid the term has become. “I found a tweet recently that said, ‘I’m \nmenhera\n so I listened to Seiko Oomori’ with a lot of emojis on it,” \nSeiko Oomori said to Cinra in 2016\n. “\nMenhera\n doesn’t mean much. People who actually take medication aren’t listening to my songs.” The term has taken a similar life to how the word “depression” has been used on social media with ironic distance making it meaningless as much as it made its topics easier to discuss.\nThe problematic treatment might complicate the perception of the music, but the works of these artists still manage to leave a sizable impact for the future. The more depressive themes seem not only more commonplace in pop but also more accessible in recent years. The conversations stemming from these themes appear on rather unassuming pop at least relative to the more intense music that came before. You can definitely chalk up the change in attitude to the uncertain times, but part of that I think also has to do with these artists who confronted these dark emotions in their music despite whatever insensitive name they were being called.\n***\nPhew! A longer essay to start this issue, so I’ll keep it short here. Album of the Week is technically not so new, but I have my reasons why it’s there. Please enjoy the singles but please do enjoy the Oricon revisit, especially if you like Yellow Magic Orchestra. Happy listening!\nAlbum of the Week\nDeep Blue\n by Sora Tob Sakana [NBC Universal]\nRecommended track: “\nSignal\n” \n| \nListen to it on \nSpotify\nThe trajectory of Sora Tob Sakana in the past year has felt a tad uncertain after a member’s graduation reducing the idol group down to a trio, but their music has been more promising than ever. The lack of predictability in their future translated to something more creatively optimistic with last year’s full-length, \nWorld Fragment Tour\n, suggesting that their already-well-defined math-rock sound still had a lot more room to grow. It was a shock, then, to hear the group announce that they will disband this fall after releasing what will be their last full-length album, \nDeep Blue\n.\nAdmittedly, \nDeep Blue\n is not entirely new. While it is bookended by two new songs, “\nSignal\n” and “\nUntie\n,” the rest consists of re-recording of old songs, a good half pulled from their self-titled 2016 album. The new context that surrounds the group, however, transforms the songs from their original state. Familiar lyrics now bear new meanings, and the awe-inspiring music functions with a different purpose. \nDeep Blue\n resonates deeper than just a greatest-hits collection, offering a second look at Sora Tob Sakana’s most cherished songs.\nThe group’s early songs thrived off of innocence and naivete. Part of that came from the idols’ own lack of context with the music they worked with. “In the beginning, we actually sang and performed without understanding that the songs were difficult,” \nFuuka Kanzaki said\n about recording their tracks produced by Yoshimasa Terui, who also leads math-rock-inspired bands such as siraph. Led by their meek voices, Sora Tob Sakana’s self-titled album brought an experience as though you were discovering these new sounds and emotions alongside them. Those sounds unfurl even more vividly thanks to the album’s remastering job, the guitars benefiting the most as the tinny riffs get restored so they can shine as vibrant and dynamic as they should.\nChildish innocence fades away from those familiar songs as they return with more experience but also the foresight of their imminent split. The exuberant music once suggested a lush world full of infinite possibilities; now, that same exuberance instead communicates their time rapidly slipping away. “Tick, tock, time still passes by / No one can stop it / Like it will probably go on forever / I’m not a kid anymore.” Such lyrics hits poignant now with their numbered days in mind, and even more when you realize it comes from their first-ever single, “\nYozora Wo Zenbu\n.”\nIt’s bittersweet to consider that Sora Tob Sakana’s early triumphs have also become their swan song, but \nDeep Blue\n ultimately sings a life well lived rather than wallowing in melancholy. The rock music, a mix of wide-eyed electronica and zipping math-rock, still explodes with inimitable energy, and the added polish to the production pumps even more soul for the group’s last hurrah. The idols’ voices, too, have grown sharper, showing off more control of their complex surroundings. Not only do they sound wiser when it comes to articulating their emotions, the three seem unfazed whenever they sing lyrics about the overwhelming speed of life. Sora Tob Sakana accept their time has come to an end, and their embrace of finality inspires a whole new perspective of their music.\nSingles Club\n“Cream” by macominaming [Oiran Music]\nMacominaming’s latest track lulls in and out of a comforting slumber as the glowing synths hum a sleepy tune. The indie-pop duo, too, seems deep in a their dreams as the two softly whisper a verse about how they can’t tell up from down. Their stroll through the subconscious sounds like a delight especially as they get to the hook, stretching out the long syllable of the titular word like sweet taffy.\nListen to the single on \nBandcamp\n.\nSee also:\n “\nSettee\n” by Newly ft. Kojikoji; “\nAfter Five\n” by O’chawanz\n“Yes and No” by Dreams Come True [Universal Sigma]\nI started watching the medical TV drama \nUnsung Cinderella: Midori, The Hospital Pharmacist\n about a few weeks ago. The episodes remain pretty earnest without too many pockets of comedy, and so I expected a theme song from Dreams Come True that’s just as sincere and sentimental—a mood that the duo have historically nailed with their collection of drama-theme-turned-hits. But as the episode entered its final sappy moments, I noticed, hey, do I hear a break beat? Considering the duo’s \njolly \nasadora\n entry\n from last year, a sly inclusion of drum breaks was a big curve ball that I had to investigate a bit further.\n“Yes and No” really is one of the edgiest singles to come from the J-pop veterans. R&B has been their foundation since the ‘90s, but the fancy electronic production here is something else. The retro new wave could be easily re-fitted into a synthwave track; if you enjoyed the icy Vangelis synths of The Weeknd’s \nAfter Hours\n, the sleek, cinematic flair of this single should also excite. Miwa Yoshida and her soulful vocals gel well with the lush music, adding a golden feel as though “Yes and No” is a lost pop hit from the opulent ‘80s.\nListen to the single on \nSpotify\n.\nSee also:\n “\nUtopia\n” by AAAMYYY; “\nNight D\n” by Eill\n“Snooze” by Zombie-Chang [Roman Label / Bayon Production]\nMeirin Yung has been playing with electro this year, releasing the resulting one-offs on her YouTube page, and the synth-twiddling experiments come to full fruition in her new Zombie-Chang album, \nTake Me Away from Tokyo\n. The spastic electronics such as the one firing off in “Snooze” initially made for more extroverted music relative to her previous output, which seemed conflicting at first with what I enjoy about Yung’s songs. My favorite singles of hers try and fail at fighting against inertia, never quite reaching full catharsis.\nThe more I immerse myself into the wonky sounds, however, the song becomes as hypnotic as her previous releases with the crowding of noise inviting sensory paralysis. The overwhelm is fitting for such a song with Yung wandering in a half-asleep state while a buzzing alarm echoes in the distance—”gotta shut it off,” she repeats in her signature dead-pan cadence as the iPhone ringer incessantly beeps.\nTake Me Away from Tokyo \nis out now. Listen to it on \nSpotify\n.\nSee also:\n “\nMurmur\n” by Pasocom Music Club; “\nTurbulence\n” by Wata Igarashi\nThis Week in 1981…\n“High School Lullaby” by Imo-Kin Trio [For Life, 1981]\nNo. 1 during the weeks of Aug. 24 - Oct. 5, 1981\n | \nListen to it on \nYouTube\nThe Oricon charts truly feel like the Wild West sometimes with it allowing space for an act like Imo-Kin Trio to climb up to number one. None of the three in the group are musicians but instead talents in entertainment, who starred as regulars in the variety TV program \nKindon! Yoiko Waruiko Futsunoko\n. While TV spawned hits either through a drama series or audition programs, Imo-Kin Trio was one of the first where a variety show assembled their talents to debut a pop group. \nThe resulting debut single “High School Lullaby” provides a neat look at what was trendy in Japanese pop at the time in 1981. Imo-Kin Trio’s name is a portmanteau of YMO, or Yellow Magic Orchestra, and Johnny’s idol group Tanokin Trio, and the group’s initial make-up essentially resembles what you’d imagine as the other end of that bizarre boy-band formula. The former’s Haruomi Hosono produced the music; the technopop new wave is definitely the work of the master, down to the drum-machine count-in that echoes “\nRydeen\n.” The three sing about their one-sided crush over the skipping electronic beat, the chorus featuring one saccharine hook: “\nbaby, I love you / so suki suki baby\n,” they call out in unison.\nThe origin story sets a precedent for a lot of the future TV-born novelty hits in the Oricon. The trio loosely stands as a reference for something like the music career of comedy duo Tunnels, whose star status retroactively feeds into the appeal of the music that they put out on the side during the ‘80s and early ‘90s. The launch of Imo-Kin definitely cast a shadow over the novelty records that came straight from the segments of the Heisei variety program \nTunnels No Minasan No Okagedeshita\n: the debut of Yaen in 1998 from the show essentially updates the YMO rip of “High School Lullaby” into \na Kinki Kids parody\n.\nThe difference with Imo-Kin is that the members had just got into television with \nKindon!\n and so “High School Lullaby” is propelled more by the trendiness of YMO than necessarily the star power of the involved talents. Conversely, though, it goes to show how the world of Japanese television can launch just about any music career through sheer synergy even if the talents in question have little ambitions to establish themselves in the music realm. The fact that they succeeded using YMO as their vehicle is a cherry on top to one peculiar pop story.\nNext issue is out September 2. \nYou can check out previous issues here\n.

This term is commonly used to describe Harajuku styles.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\n\nCode or Coord (コード/コーデ)\n[\n]\n\nCode or Coord are used to represent \"coordination\" or outfit and are often used at the end of hashtags on social media.\n\nCoquettish (コケティッシュ)\n[\n]\n\nWithin Japanese magazines, this term is often used to describe a style that is sexy and appeals to men. It is used mainly for adults and can be a way to simply describe \"sex appeal.\" Common themes amongst \"coquettish\" styles are sheer clothing, tighter skirt styles, off-the-shoulder clothing, and clothing with slits near the legs. Natural but sexy makeup is often also described with this term, as well as stylishly disheveled hairstyles.\n[\n5\n]\n\nConservative (コンサバ)\n[\n]\n\nConservative is used within Japanese fashion to mean a modest, not so flashy or bold, and vintage feeling fashion. It is often used to refer to styles that resemble Japanese fashion from the 80s, as well as formal feminine fashions, and neat and clean styles. Conservative styles are often similar to business casual types of styles, with a tendency towards high fashion looks. \n[\n6\n]\n\nDekiru Onna (デキる女)\n[\n]\n\nDekiru Onna is a term used to describe female fashion that provokes a professional, proper or appropriate, formal, and \"deep\" feeling. The style involves more formal wear and business style clothing, including basic color schemes and a use of black. It also can be used to describe high fashion or name brand accessories and clothing with the same style and feel.\n[\n7\n]\n\nEffortless Fashion (エフォートレスファッション)\n[\n]\n\nThe term effortless is used to describe fashion that is fashionable but relaxed. \n[\n8\n]\n\nThe Feeling of Omission (抜け感/Nuke-kan)\n[\n]\n\nThe Feeling of Omission, or nukekan, is used to describe a style that is \"missing\" something, as well as a mature, elegant, and light style. This can mean strategic snowing of skin, a strategic use of a lack of color, as well as fashion that is stylishly bordering casual and formal, or disheveled and put together.\n[\n9\n]\n\nIta (痛)\n[\n]\n\nIta in J-fashion is used for things that are \"cringey\", or \"painful\" to look at. In Lolita fashion, Ita-lolita (痛ロリィタ) refers to Lolita fashion attempts that are poorly or incorrectly coordinated.\n[\n10\n]\n\nKaiwai (界隈)\n[\n]\n\nNot to be confused with \"kawaii\", the term is generally used in the sense of \"community\" and often part of hashtags that were created for the purpose of connecting with others from the same community. For example, \"ロリィタ界隈\" refers to the Lolita community.\n\nKei (系)\n[\n]\n\nKei is the japanese suffix for \"kind\" or \"type\" in terms of categorization. In fashion it is often used to categorize outfits by their style or color, for example, ピンク系 refers to an all-pink outfit \n[\n11\n]\n. However, if used incorrectly, kei can refer to a specific \"type\" of person, usually a stereotype. For example, “fairy-type fashion” (フェアリー 系ファッション) refers to fairy subculture fashion, but \"fairy-type boy\" (フェアリー 系男の子) refers to the \"fairy boy\" stereotype of a charming but cruel male love interest. Similarly, the term Jirai Kei/Landmine-type (地雷系) can refer to a stereotypical archetype for girls who dress in certain darker fashion styles.\n[\n12\n]\n\nNormcore (ノームコア)\n[\n]\n\nAlthough originally an English fashion term, Normcore is also used in Japanese fashion magazines since 2014 to mean timeless, normal, and simple fashion.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n14\n]\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\n\nOld-School or Nostalgic (ノスタルジック)\n[\n]\n\nCommonly used in front of the names of decades-old fashion styles, such as Lolita and Gyaru, when referring to their \"original\" version.\n\nOtona (大人)\n[\n]\n\nLiterally translating to \"adult\", is a suffix commonly used to indicate the \"mature\" versions of a style that are toned-down.\n\nOver-the-top (コテコテ/Kote-kote)\n[\n]\n\nAn outfit of any style that is accessorized from head to toe, also the opposite of \"plain\" or \"casual\".\n\nRed Letter Fashion (赤文字系/Aka-moji Kei)\n[\n]\n\nRed letter fashion is used to describe fashion that is, in many ways, the opposite of \"blue letter fashions\" and Harajuku fashions. The style is most commonly a conservative, formal, and feminine style. It can be described as fashion that is \"office appropriate.\" \n[\n3\n]\n[\n17\n]\n[\n18\n]\n\nSabukaru or Subcul (サブカル)\n[\n]\n\nA Japanese slang term that refers to people, styles, or things that are considered \"subcultural\" or \"alternative\". Most styles considered J-Fashion overseas fall under it with being alternative fashion. \n[\n19\n]\n[\n20\n]\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n↑\n \n\"What is bitter coordination?

That’d be incredibly inappropriate for me to do, as I don’t know any of them well enough to know if they are a part of the jirai kei subculture. I am simply listing vtubers who seem to be the most popular within the ryousanjirai crowd, that is those whose female fanbase seems to have a higher proportion of ryousanjirai girls than most. \nThe other thing I’d like to get out of the way is that some vtubers on this list are known for using “menhera” as an insult. Sadly, thats grown popular in the vtuber scene and online spaces in japan. For vtuber fans reading this who think that’s a weird thing to say, the word “menhera” has been around since 2001 and was the name given to an internet subculture revolving around mental health safe spaces, awareness, and vent art. Even tho it was literally created to help erase the “mental illness makes you dangerous” thing, the stigma took over once the term went mainstream, so its often used to mean “yandere psycho”. The subculture still exists if you know where to look, but barely ever uses the name it gave itself anymore because it attracts trolls, edgelords, and fetishists.\nOne last thing- a few of these girls fit the “loli” archetype, and consider it a part of their appeal, but no minors will be featured on this list.\nabsolutely zero past-life discussion\nI’ll do my best to summarize what the vtuber is known for and the reasons i think are likely why their female fanbase has a larger proportion of ryousanjirai girls. \n1. Sakamata Chloe (Hololive HoloX)\nGiven that she recently got a new outfit that looks a lot like a dark girly kei coord, you’ve probably seen Chloe on your feed recently. Despite her yamikawaii punk-ish look, she’s so cute and probably couldn’t survive in the wild if she were a real orca. The “pon” is unreal. Her original songs talk about her own inner pain in a way that may be relatable to jirai girls, and she’s covered a lot of songs popular with us too (such as Cute Loving and Devil Janai Mon). Between her cutesiness, choice in fashion, and her songs, it’s easy to see why she’s loved by jirai kei girls.\n2. Minato Aqua (Hololive Gen. 2)\nYou probably know about Aqua if you follow me, since I just posted a link to one of her more recent song covers. It’s one about a ryousangata girl falling in love with a host, and knowing his affection is fake but wanting it anyway. She covers a lot of songs about topics that are familiar to ryousan and jirai girls, like kyuukurarin, darling dance, goodbye declaration, and internet overdose to name a few. Her original songs are also hits with the ryousangata crowd, with “aqua iro palette” being the choice of song in so many tiktoks and reels of ryousan wotas showing off their lavish birthday celebrations for their oshis. She’s also a cosplayer, frequently wearing maid outfits, making her relatable to a lot of girls who work at concept cafes. She also did a duet with Shion, a cover of “menhera janai mon”, which is a song i often see misinterpreted outside of japan because of the need for cultural context on jirai kei, ryousangata, and menhera both as a subculture and insult. Should I do a post explaining the lyrics and overall themes? \n3. Makaino Ririmu (Nijisanji Gamers Generation 3)\nListen. If you’re in the jirai kei subculture, I guarantee you’ve seen Ririmu. This girl’s fanart is probably on every jirai kei blog known to man. If you don’t recognize this model, you’d recognize the maid outfit with bondage elements thats paired with a coat that looks suspiciously like REFLEM’s bunny ears coat (the one that took yamikawa lovers by storm a while back). Ririmu’s popularity with jirai kei girls isn’t just because she likes similar fashions to most of us. Ririmu has been open about her past suffering with agorophobia, suicidal ideation, and being a NEET. She’s shared bits and pieces of her recovery with her fans! Of course, she also does yandere bit that might be more than a bit, and covers a lot of songs popular with ryousan and jirai girls, like more kyun, chuupuri, and vampire.\n4. Mikeneko (Indie)\nMikeneko isn’t new to the scene at all, but has recently come out of a partly mental health related hiatus to a much larger following than before. Mikeneko collects models like they’re pokemon cards, going thru four in total now, two of which have been in one year. She wears tons of yamikawa fashions, and plays up her chuunibyou for streams. Aside from her on-and-off NEETdom, Mikeneko is open about a lot of her health issues, including bipolar, and about her medication and trips to the psychiatric hospital. She calls herself menhera, often in the secondary meaning, but she’s also rumored to have been a part of the actual subculture for a long time. Her original songs, drop and you&me ring really true for a lot of jirai and menhera girls such as myself.\n5. Meloco Kyoran (Nijisanji EN Generation 7)\nMeloco is the only vtuber on this list to be a part of an company’s EN (english-speaking) branch. She’s included on the list because she’s also big in japan- because she’s japanese. She’s almost fluent in english and was accepted for the english branch, but frequently slips into japanese and appeals to her japanese fans. Her outfit is gothic lolita inspired with bondage elements and plenty of edge, to fit her overall spooky exorcist theming. Her creepy-cute nature and cool alternative onee-san demeanor have attracted her many jirai kei fans, and inspired a lot of ryousan girls’ oshi nails.\n6. Sukoya Kana (Nijisanji Tulip-gumi Unit)\nAdmittedly, Kana’s probably got more menhera (as in the subculture) fans than jirai or ryousan, but she still has enough that I wanted to include her. Her nurse theming isn’t just a gimmick, her actual “day job” is as a nurse. As in, when she’s not streaming, she works in a hospital as staff after passing her qualifying exams in 2022! She must be super busy! Her morbid interests and fetishes, as well as her medical themed design, have no doubt appealed to many jirai girls too. Besides that, she’s covered a lot of songs, including quite a few beloved by landmines such as lavie, nainai girls pride, and godish.\n7. Natori Sana (Indie)\nListen, I just know you’ve seen her figures by now. Every menhera, yamikawaii, and “cutecore” account in the west has at least one of this nurse girl’s figures. She’s ultra cute, with a sickeningly sweet smile and design. Her lore is interesting- she claims to work at a sanitarium, but has hinted very heavily many times that she is in fact not a nurse, but a patient in denial. Whether this is just lore for fun and appeal or is a dramatized reflection of Sana’s own feelings and mental health is up for speculation.\n8. La+ (Laplus) Darkness (HoloX)\nRemember that disclaimer regarding using menhera derogatorily earlier? Yeah that’s 90% because of Laplus’s inclusion on the list. It feels like she accuses someone of being menhera (derogatory) like every other VOD. Apart from that, Laplus is a grade A kusogaki, complete with constant angry outburst when things don’t go her way. She’s a demon whos intelligence was… “sealed away”… sure. Her gothic appearance and explosive personality seem to be what’s gained her such a large jirai kei following.\n9. Houshou Marine (Hololive Gen. 3)\nDear god. Alright, so you’ve definitely heard at least two of her songs if you’re on japanese jirai kei SNS at all. This cosplaying pirate is so horny that it’s literally considered her catchphrase. Her original songs about wanting to be seen as desirable and be… pleasured seem to be especially popular with landmine girls (which is maybe related to how many jirai girls are in a certain profession). She enjoys gothic lolita fashion, girls love/yuri, and enough fetishes to lose track of if you’re counting. \n10. Shigure Ui (Indie)\nDid you really think I could make this list without including hololive star Oozora Subaru’s mom and voice of the song that’s plaguing japanese social media, ESPECIALLY landmine social media rn? Sure, it’s everywhere, but go check every insta kaiwai dedicated to jirai subculture and see how many of their reels have this song. Even though she’s just now broken out to this degree of fame, she’s been around a while, and is the “mama” (artist) to several other vtubers. She often collabs with hololive members! She loves taboo fiction, which is also especially popular amongst jirai girls.\nLast but not least, I want to add three honorable mentions from Hololive that are also popular with ryousanjirai girls. Tokoyami Towa is a super popular choice of cosplay amongst jirai girls specifically. She has a cute-but-cool look, and lots of her outfits definitely have subcultural influences from japanese ゴスパンク (gothic x punk) and general “egirl”-type styles. Murasaki Shion is a very popular choice of profile pic for ryousanjirai girls, and it’s easy to see why. Her “kusogaki” appeal and lolita outfits, as well as her “Menhera Janai Mon” duet with Aqua all appeal to that demographic. Finally, last honorable mention is Amane Kanata, purely because of how popular she is with lovers of Tenshi Kaiwai, which has a lot of overlap with the jirai subculture. She basically predicted the trend before the magazine that popularized it even existed. Mizuiro x white cybercore outfits, a nurse cosplay, and angel theming make her a spot-on icon in that scene.\nThat’s it! Now I have to stop procrastinating on the pien kei characters post…\n\n \n\n \n \n64 notes\n\nalternativelis\n liked this \ngivemeyourfaceplzzz\n liked this \nfeargardenz\n liked this \nporcelanitaa\n liked this \nbonehalos\n liked this \ndigital-angelz\n liked this \np1nkmedusa\n liked this \nhimenako\n liked this \nzitds\n liked this \njiraiyui\n liked this \n3xistent14lcrisis\n liked this \ncarrotflowerboy\n liked this \ncandyebun\n liked this \nditzypudding\n liked this \ndinight866\n reblogged this from \npienhime\n \nkeyqu1455\n liked this \noracleofdykey\n liked this \novertnihilist\n liked this \nsemisweet-heart\n reblogged this from \npienhime\n \nsemisweet-heart\n liked this \nrosenlita\n liked this \npoorpastel-pain\n liked this \ncottoncandydreamsandlace\n liked this \ntetsudouprincess\n liked this \npersocons\n liked this \njirai-girl\n liked this \nddrexpert\n liked this \narsonistman\n liked this \nchacharcherry\n liked this \ntorashii-tk\n liked this \npastel-mo0n\n liked this \ngonathanwithag\n liked this \nmari-wa-landmine\n liked this \nyustandforrain\n liked this \nwriting-bella\n liked this \ndoll-lesbian\n liked this \nkanon-byrnhildr\n liked this \npixistix-and-poprox\n liked this \nchesheyer\n liked this \npienhime\n posted this \n\n Two important things to know before you read any further: I am NOT alleging any of these vtubers to be jirai kei.

However, with changes in times and discourse environments, the meaning of the term has evolved based on social realities, developing different nuances. The term itself has also expanded its reach with the advancement of communication technologies, particularly forming a new youth subculture phenomenon in China. This article separately outlines the developmental history of \"Jirai Onna\" in both China and Japan, and provides a distinct summary of the developing history of \"Jirai Onna\" in both China and Japan. Finally, it provides a potential analysis of the factors that contribute to the disparities in the Landmine Girl culture that exist between China and Japan. The expectation is that this will be of use to researchers in the future who are investigating different young subculture organizations.\n\nKeywords: \n\nCultural Differences, Jirai Onna, Subculture\n\n Download PDF\n \n\n View PDF\n\nSun,R.

Social Networking Services (SNS), with their User-Generated Content (UGC) production model, have broken the monopoly of professionals over discourse power, promoting spontaneous communication among ordinary users and fostering a space for the flourishing of niche subcultures.\n\nAs East Asian countries, China and Japan share similar cultural foundations. The languages they use have commonalities in meaning, and their social atmospheres are also more alike. This provides a natural foundation for grassroots cultural exchanges. However, similar to other communication activities, subcultures inevitably present a more localized appearance in the final decoding stage of their dissemination process.\n\nThis paper selects the \"Jirai Kei\" (地雷系) culture originating from Japan, as an example, tracing its history and development in both China and Japan.\" It is more effective to discuss subcultures on the basis of discussing society. The analysis of fictional worlds is closely related to the understanding of the real world \"[1].\n\nMost previous research has focused on the dissemination process of subcultures or the psychological challenges faced by subcultural groups [2][3][4]. Few studies have conducted detailed comparisons of a specific subculture between two countries and explored the communication activities involved.\n\nThis paper aims to provide a reference case for future cross-cultural research and to enhance the objective understanding of the \"Jirai Kei\" culture group by the outside world.\n\n2.\n Main discussion \n\n2.1.\n The history of Jirai Kei culture in Japan \n\nThe origins of Jirai Kei culture can be traced back to the term \"Jirai Onna\" (地雷女), a popular internet catchphrase used around 2010 on the Japanese anonymous forum 2 channel (2ちゃんねる). This term was used to describe women who appeared cute on the surface but had serious issues in intimate relationships. Due to their seemingly harmless exterior hiding a potentially destructive nature—similar to a \"ticking time bomb\"—they were labeled as \"Jirai Onna\" or \"landmine women.\" When used to describe others, the term carries a derogatory connotation, often implying that the person suffers from mental illness. \n\nOther similar catchphrases include \"Pien-kei\" (ぴえん系) and \"Menhera\" (ﾒﾝﾍﾗ). \"Pien-kei\" is widely believed to have emerged around 2018 in the Kabukicho (歌舞伎町) area, named after the popular EMOJI \"Pleading Face\" (ぴえん) frequently used by Japanese youth. The rise of Pien-kei girls is closely tied to Kabukicho's host club industry. Sasaki Chiwawa [5] argues that \"Pien-kei girls essentially desire to be cute, but not everyone can achieve the 'mainstream' cuteness of actresses or models on TV. As a result, they gather in Kabukicho, where spending money can earn them compliments on their cuteness, and they fulfill their desires by spending on hosts.\" Through this behavior, which differs from traditional romantic relationships and is referred to as \"oshi\" (推し), they find meaning in their lives [6]. \n\nThe word \"Menhera\" emerged around the same time as \"Jirai Onna.\" It is a Japanese internet adaptation of the English term \"mental health\" and first appeared in the mental health section of 2channel. This term is most frequently used in Japanese research on Jirai Kei culture and is often associated with mental illnesses such as borderline personality disorder [7].\n\nGoogle search data also shows that \"Jirai Onna\" and \"Menhera\" had similar search frequencies during the same period, while the search curve for \"Pien-kei\" clearly reflects the characteristics of a new catchphrase emerging around 2020.\n\nFigure 1: Global search popularity of \"Jirai Onna\" (Blue Line), \"Menhera\" (Green Line), and \"Pien-kei\" (Red Line) from January 2004 to February 13, 2025\n\nAlthough the three catchphrases—\"Jirai Onna,\" \"Menhera,\" and \"Pien-kei\"—differ in their etymology, origins, and time of emergence, they share similar meanings. All are used to describe individuals (primarily women) who appear delicate and pitiable on the surface but are emotionally unstable or mentally troubled. We collectively refer to these three catchphrases as \"Jirai Kei\" in the following sections.\n\n2.2.\n The current state of Jirai Kei in Japan \n\n2.2.1.\n Jirai Kei as a standalone fashion culture \n\nIn contemporary Japan, Jirai Kei has evolved beyond its original catchphrase to become a distinct fashion subculture. This transformation reflects the complex interplay between online identity and real-world expression of young people.\n\nJirai Kei is characterized by its mix of cuteness and darkness, often incorporating elements such as pastel colors, frilly dresses, and childlike accessories alongside darker motifs like crosses, bandages, and gothic-inspired details. This aesthetic serves as a visual metaphor for the inner turmoil and emotional instability associated with the Jirai Kei identity. \n\nThe rise of Jirai Kei as a fashion trend can be attributed to its resonance with individuals who feel marginalized or misunderstood by mainstream society. By adopting this style, they express their struggles with mental health, relationships, and societal pressures in a way that is both personal and communal. Social media platforms, particularly Instagram and Twitter, have played a significant role in popularizing Jirai Kei fashion, allowing individuals to share their outfits, connect with like-minded people, and build a sense of belonging. Jirai Kei as a youth subculture reflect the values of youths today and resist elements of society in a visually stimulating way [8].\n\nHowever, the commercialization of Jirai Kei fashion had sparked debates. Some critics argue that the subculture's origins in mental health struggles and emotional vulnerability are being diluted as it becomes more mainstream.\n\n2.2.2.\n To-yoko kids(ﾄｰ横ｷｯｽﾞ) with Jirai Kei\n\nNext to the Toho Building in Kabukicho, there are often many young people gathered alone, wandering outside. Most of them are between 12 and 19 years old, having chosen to run away from home due to conflicts with their parents. Their numbers are so large that it has become a social phenomenon, and they are referred to by a specific term: \"To-yoko kids\" (ﾄｰ横ｷｯｽﾞ). \n\nMany of these To-yoko kids are minors who have not completed their education and lack the skills to make a living, making it difficult for them to participate in regular work. To cover daily expenses, many young women turn to \"sugar dating\" (ﾊﾟﾊﾟ活 ) relationships to earn money. Some girls choose to wear \"Jirai Kei\" fashion. This cute style not only enhances their physical attractiveness but also helps them quickly become the part of To-yoko kids community.\n\nMany people living here have no time to plan for the future, and they can only drift through the red-light district. The culture of the red-light district subtly influences their habits. Many To-yoko kids have unhealthy practices such as drug overdose, self-harm, and prostitution [9]. These behaviors serve as desperate ways for them to cope with the harsh realities they face.\n\nIt can be said that the To-yoko kids are the group that most closely aligns with the original definition of \"Jirai Onna\" today, and their expressions of it have become even more extreme. This phenomenon reflects structural deficiencies in Japanese society regarding youth protection and educational support.\n\n2.3.\n The development of Jirai Kei culture in China \n\nThe introduction of \"Jirai Kei\" to China occurred later than its emergence in Japan. Initially, it spread through anime and music, becoming integrated with otaku culture. In the early Chinese internet context, \"Jirai Kei\" did not carry a negative connotation but was instead seen as a \"cute\" associated with anime characters. The dangerous and emotionally unstable aspects of \"Jirai Onna\" were downplayed, transforming the image into one of a cute, well-dressed girl.\n\n A cute example is \"Menherachan\", a character who gained popularity on Bilibili in 2018. Another example closer to the original meaning of \"Jirai Onna\" is the VOCALOID song \"Venom\" (ﾍﾞﾉﾑ), released the same year. These two distinct perceptions of Jirai Kei culture became recognized as part of “otaku culture” in China, though they had not yet fully entered the mainstream internet lexicon. \n\nThe turning point for the development of \"Jirai Kei\" in China came after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019. Compared to the past, the pandemic lockdowns brought greater mental stress, forcing the younger generation to spend more time online.\n\nIn 2022, the release of the game “NEEDY GIRL OVERDOSE” further propelled the spread of the \"Jirai Onna\" label in China, as the game's protagonist embodied the typical appearance and mental state of a \"Jirai Onna.\" To cope with the pressures of daily life and seek emotional satisfaction and freedom, netizens began to freely create symbols and mock any form of rigidity [10][11]. Despite knowing that \"Jirai Onna\" originally carried a derogatory meaning, many people adopted self-deprecating humor to embrace and role-play as \"Jirai Onna,\" using it as a way to accept their unchangeable reality and gain a sense of belonging online [12], forming new interest-based communities. In China, these communities are primarily rooted in social platforms with a majority female user base, such as Redbook and Weibo. \n\n2.4.\n Similarities and differences between Chinese and Japanese Jirai Kei culture \n\nJapan's \"Jirai Kei\" culture started as a way to categorize real-life individuals or groups, reflecting societal realities. Essentially, it evolved from offline to online but never fully detached from its red-light district roots. This connection means the culture not only emerged from the red-light district but also draws those who identify as \"Jirai Onna\" or \"Jirai Otoko\" back into that environment.\n\nIn China, \"Jirai Kei\" culture began online and has since taken root in major social media platforms, forming virtual communities without physical gathering spaces. Unlike in Japan, Chinese enthusiasts focus less on internal struggles and more on their social media appearance, striving to match the standard Japanese \"Jirai Onna\" aesthetic. In anonymous forums, criticism often targets photos for having a \"China style\" (中味), citing issues like body shape, light makeup, or skin tone that deviate from the traditional \"Jirai Onna\" look. A brand hierarchy has also emerged, with Japanese labels favored over local ones, despite their higher cost.\n\nWhile Japanese \"Jirai Onna\" culture initially aimed to attract male attention and build relationships, its Chinese counterpart has blended with radical feminist ideas. Many Chinese \"Jirai Onna\" reject men entirely, criticizing them solely for their gender, even if they show interest in the culture. As a result, men are often excluded from participating or speaking in these communities.\n\n3.\n Conclusion\n\nDespite the many differences between Chinese and Japanese Jirai Kei cultures, there is one key similarity: just as Jirai Kei culture is gaining popularity in China, its prominence in Japan has also been rising in recent years. The resurgence of Jirai Kei culture symbolizes a shared societal pressure in both countries—unhappy family environments and overly competitive, \"involutionary\" social systems have forced young people, who feel unable to participate in this competition, to choose a path of rebellion. Through social media, ordinary people are exposed to a broader world and more possibilities, but the stark contrast between the idealized hologram of happiness online and the harsh realities of life creates a sense of helpless disconnection. Identifying with pre-modern subcultures may be a way to seek security and escape reality.\n\nWe need more unbiased understanding to clarify the root causes of these phenomena. It is hoped that future research will provide opportunities to delve deeper into the lives of Jirai Kei communities in both China and Japan, exploring how cultural dissemination operates and how geographical, economic, and political factors have shaped the same external culture into different core identities.\n\nReferences\n\n[1].

Whether someone has encountered this style through social media or anime culture, they're typically looking for guidance on how to create their jirai kei look without appropriating its deeper cultural meanings.\n\nThis style represents more than clothing choices—it's a form of emotional expression that resonates with those who find beauty in vulnerability and strength in embracing their complex feelings.\n\nWhat is Jirai Kei Fashion?\n\nJirai kei fashion emerged from Japanese internet culture in the early 2020s, originating from the derogatory term \"jirai onna\", which translates to \"landmine type\" or \"landmine girl.\" This Japanese fashion movement transforms what was initially a derogatory term into a powerful form of self-expression, combining elements of gothic lolita fashion with kawaii culture to create a distinctive aesthetic that celebrates emotional authenticity.\n\nThe Jirai Kei style centers around a carefully curated contrast between innocent, doll-like elements and darker, Gothic influences. Practitioners typically incorporate pale, porcelain-like makeup, twin-tailed hairstyles, and clothing that blends black and pink color schemes with lace, ribbons, and platform shoes. This aesthetic choice represents more than fashion—it's a visual language for expressing complex emotional states and challenging traditional notions of beauty.\n\nKey Elements of Jirai Kei Style\n\nColor Palette and Visual Harmony\n\nThe jirai kei style color scheme revolves around a sophisticated three-color system: black, white, and various shades of pink. These colors work together to create visual tension that mirrors the emotional complexity the style represents. Black provides the gothic foundation, while white adds ethereal lightness, and pink introduces the kawaii element that softens the overall dark appearance.\n\nSilhouette and Proportion\n\nJirai kei silhouettes emphasize femininity through carefully constructed proportions. High-waisted skirts create an hourglass shape while maintaining modesty, often paired with fitted tops that balance the voluminous bottom half. Platform shoes add height and drama, contributing to the doll-like aesthetic that is central to the style.\n\nLayering plays a crucial role in achieving authentic jirai proportions. Practitioners often wear multiple items simultaneously—lace socks under platform shoes, cardigans over fitted tops, or accessories that create visual interest without overwhelming the core silhouette.\n\nTexture and Material Selection\n\nFabric choices in kei fashion emphasize contrast and sensory appeal. Delicate materials like lace, chiffon, and silk create softness that balances harder elements such as leather, vinyl, or metal accessories. This textural contrast reinforces the style's core theme of juxtaposing innocence with edge.\n\nPopular Accessories in Jirai Kei\n\nHair Accessories and Styling\n\nHair accessories serve as primary focal points in jirai styling, with twin tails being the signature hairstyle. These pigtails typically feature curled ends and decorative elements such as ribbons, bows, or character-themed clips. The positioning and styling of twin tails requires practice to achieve the proper doll-like proportions that define the aesthetic.\n\nBeyond basic twin tails, advanced practitioners incorporate specialized accessories, such as hair rings, decorative bobby pins, or themed clips featuring characters from anime or gaming culture.\n\nBag Selection and Symbolic Items\n\nSmall backpacks, particularly those with character themes or in the signature color palette, serve both practical and aesthetic functions. These bags often feature additional decorative elements, such as keychains, pins, or attached plushies.\n\nBeyond mainstream options, Jirai practitioners often customize their bags with pins, patches, or attachments that reflect personal interests while maintaining aesthetic coherence.\n\nPlatform Shoes and Footwear\n\nPlatform shoes represent perhaps the most immediately recognizable element of jirai kei fashion. These shoes typically feature significant height increases—often 2-4 inches—while incorporating design elements like buckles, straps, or decorative hardware. The platforms serve multiple functions: they alter body proportions to create a more doll-like appearance, add drama to the overall look, and provide opportunities for expressing personal style through design choices.\n\nHow to Create Your Own Jirai Kei Look\n\nBuilding a Foundation Wardrobe\n\nCreating an authentic Jirai wardrobe begins with establishing foundational pieces that can be mixed and matched effectively. Start with a high-waisted pleated skirt in black or dark gray, as this item serves as the cornerstone for most jirai outfits. Pair this with fitted tops in white or pale pink that can accommodate layering with cardigans or light jackets.\n\nThe plus-size community has enthusiastically embraced jirai kei fashion, with many pieces available in extended sizing that maintain the essential proportions and aesthetic elements. When building a foundation wardrobe, prioritize fit over exact brand matching, as proper proportions matter more than specific labels for achieving authentic presentation.\n\nEssential Jirai Kei Pieces and Styling\n\nFor those seeking authentic Jirai pieces, \nMOEFLAVOR offers anime-inspired designs\n in inclusive sizing from XS to 4XL. Their \ngyaru jirai kei collection\n features carefully curated pieces that capture the aesthetic's essential elements while maintaining high-quality construction and attention to detail.\n\nThe \nJapanese Jirai Kei Babydoll Lingerie Set\n exemplifies the style's balance between innocence and edge, featuring delicate lace details paired with the signature black and pink color scheme. This piece demonstrates how Jirai fashion transforms intimate wear into artistic expression while maintaining comfort and quality craftsmanship.\n\nFor swimwear options that embody Jirai aesthetics, the \nJirai Kei Grey Pink Bikini\n showcases how the style adapts to different garment categories while preserving its core visual elements. The thoughtful color combination and design details reflect the movement's emphasis on authentic expression through carefully considered aesthetic choices.\n\nJirai Kei Makeup Application Techniques\n\nJirai kei makeup focuses on creating a doll-like appearance that emphasizes large eyes, pale complexion, and subtle color accents. This makeup style begins with a pale foundation that creates a porcelain-like skin tone, often lighter than the natural skin tone, to achieve the ethereal quality central to the aesthetic. This pale base serves as the canvas for more dramatic eye makeup and lip makeup treatments.\n\nLayering and Coordination\n\nSuccessful jirai styling requires mastering layering techniques that create visual interest without appearing cluttered. Start with basic combinations—such as a fitted top under an open cardigan—then gradually incorporate additional elements like lace socks, decorative belts, or layered necklaces. Each additional layer should contribute to the overall aesthetic rather than competing for attention.\n\nThe \nJapanese Jirai Kei Garter Lingerie Set\n demonstrates advanced layering principles, combining multiple elements that work together to create a cohesive visual impact. This type of detailed construction shows how MOEFLAVOR's exclusive designs offer custom-fit options with separate top and bottom sizing, accommodating diverse body types while maintaining aesthetic integrity.\n\nThe Meaning Behind Jirai Kei Style\n\nCultural Context and Emotional Expression\n\nJirai kei fashion represents more than aesthetic choices—it functions as a form of emotional communication that allows practitioners to externalize complex feelings about identity, vulnerability, and strength. The style emerged from Japanese youth culture during a period of social isolation and uncertainty, providing a visual language for experiences that traditional fashion categories couldn't address.\n\nCommunity and Support Networks\n\nOnline communities centered around Jirai fashion often function as informal support networks where participants share not only styling advice but also emotional experiences and mutual encouragement. These communities demonstrate how fashion subcultures can provide meaningful connections and understanding for individuals who might otherwise feel isolated or misunderstood.\n\nIdentity and Self-Empowerment\n\nFor many practitioners, Jirai fashion provides a framework for exploring and expressing identity in ways that mainstream fashion cannot accommodate. The style's embrace of contradictions—cute yet dark, innocent yet knowing—mirrors the complexity of contemporary youth experience and offers alternatives to simplified identity categories.\n\nHow Modern Trends Shape Jirai Kei\n\nDigital Culture and Social Media Influence\n\nSocial media platforms have fundamentally shaped Jirai fashion development, with various styles evolving rapidly through shared content, tutorials, and community feedback. Unlike traditional fashion movements that developed through print media or physical scenes, Jirai represents one of the first major fashion subcultures to originate and develop primarily through digital platforms.\n\nTikTok tutorials and Instagram posts provide accessible education about styling techniques, makeup application, and outfit coordination. This digital accessibility has democratized participation in Jirai culture while enabling rapid style evolution and international adoption. The visual nature of these platforms particularly suits Jirai's emphasis on carefully constructed aesthetic presentation.\n\nGlobal Adaptation and Local Interpretation\n\nAs Jirai spreads internationally, practitioners adapt core elements to local contexts while maintaining essential aesthetic principles. These adaptations demonstrate the style's flexibility and cultural resilience, as practitioners find ways to honor origins while making the aesthetic relevant to their cultural contexts and practical needs.\n\nInternational practitioners often incorporate locally available brands and materials while maintaining color palettes, silhouettes, and styling principles that connect their presentations to the broader jirai community.\n\nCommercial Development and Accessibility\n\nThe growing popularity of Jirai fashion has attracted commercial attention, with various retailers developing lines specifically targeting this market. MOEFLAVOR stands out by offering original anime-inspired designs that aren't mass-produced copies, ensuring each piece maintains the authenticity and exclusivity that Jirai enthusiasts value. Their commitment to inclusive sizing and custom-fit options reflects an understanding of the community's diverse needs and body-positive values.\n\nSocial Media's Role in Spreading Jirai Kei Style\n\nPlatform-Specific Development\n\nDifferent social media platforms have contributed uniquely to the Jirai fashion development and dissemination. Instagram's visual focus supports the carefully curated aesthetic presentation central to Jirai culture, while TikTok's short-form video format proves ideal for makeup tutorials and styling demonstrations. YouTube offers a platform for longer-form educational content and community discussions.\n\nThese platform differences create complementary functions within the broader Jirai digital ecosystem. Practitioners often maintain a presence across multiple platforms, utilizing each for its strengths—Instagram for outfit inspiration, TikTok for techniques, and YouTube for detailed tutorials or community discussions.\n\nInfluencer Culture and Authentic Representation\n\nKey influencers within Jirai culture often emphasize education and community building over pure aesthetic presentation. The most respected figures in Jirai social media combine styling expertise with cultural literacy, helping newcomers understand not just how to achieve the look but also its significance and proper context.\n\nThis educational approach distinguishes Jirai influencer culture from more commercialized fashion promotion. Authentic jirai content creators typically prioritize community welfare and cultural respect over individual promotion, creating content that serves the broader community rather than simply building personal brands.\n\nGlobal Community Formation\n\nSocial media enables international Jirai communities to form and maintain connections across geographic boundaries. These global communities share resources, provide mutual support, and collaborate on cultural development, all while respecting the Japanese origins of the style. This international participation enriches Jirai culture while demonstrating fashion's potential for meaningful cross-cultural communication.\n\nJirai Kei's Presence in Japanese Pop Culture\n\nAnime and Gaming Influences\n\nJirai fashion draws significant inspiration from anime and gaming culture, particularly character designs that combine kawaii aesthetics with darker themes. This influence appears in specific styling choices, color combinations, and the overall approach to creating idealized yet emotionally complex presentations.\n\nThe relationship between Jirai and anime culture runs deeper than surface aesthetic borrowing. Both cultural forms explore themes of emotional complexity, identity performance, and the tension between innocence and experience that defines much contemporary Japanese youth culture. This thematic alignment explains why Jirai resonates so strongly within communities already engaged with anime and gaming culture.\n\nAccessories like the \nJirai Kei Kawaii Nails\n demonstrate how the aesthetic extends beyond clothing into detailed personal styling. These carefully designed elements reflect MOEFLAVOR's attention to authentic cultural details while providing accessible ways for practitioners to incorporate jirai elements into their overall presentation.\n\nStreet Fashion Evolution\n\nJirai represents the latest evolution in Japan's rich street fashion tradition, building on previous movements such as gothic lolita, decora, and visual kei, while addressing contemporary cultural concerns. This positioning within Japan's street fashion history provides cultural legitimacy while demonstrating the ongoing vitality of Japanese fashion innovation.\n\nMedia Representation and Cultural Impact\n\nJapanese media coverage of Jirai fashion reflects broader cultural negotiations around youth expression, mental health awareness, and changing gender roles. This coverage often emphasizes the style's role in providing creative outlets for emotional expression while raising questions about the relationship between fashion choices and psychological well-being.\n\nIf you're drawn to subversive and expressive fashion, you might also enjoy our guide on \nsexy Halloween costume ideas\n, where bold styling meets character-inspired confidence. For a deeper dive into artistic self-expression through restraint and aesthetics, explore our breakdown of \nwhat is Shibari\n —a visual and emotional art form with strong ties to Japanese culture.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is the main appeal of Jirai Kei fashion?\n\nThe primary appeal lies in Jirai's unique ability to express emotional complexity through visual aesthetics. Unlike mainstream fashion that often emphasizes simplicity or obvious beauty standards, Jirai celebrates contradiction and depth. Practitioners find liberation in a style that acknowledges both the light and dark aspects of the human experience, while creating striking visual presentations that command attention and respect.\n\nCan anyone adopt the Jirai Kei style regardless of age or background?\n\nWhile Jirai originated within Japanese youth culture, its core principles of authentic self-expression and emotional honesty can resonate across age groups and cultural backgrounds. Older practitioners may adapt elements such as color palettes or makeup techniques while adjusting silhouettes and styling choices to suit their lifestyle needs. The key lies in understanding the cultural significance while finding personal ways to honor its meaning.\n\nHow can someone start incorporating Jirai Kei elements into their existing wardrobe?\n\nBegin with small additions that introduce key elements without requiring complete wardrobe replacement. A black pleated skirt paired with existing tops, platform shoes worn with current outfits, or jirai-inspired makeup techniques can provide an introduction to the aesthetic. Gradually incorporate accessories like hair ribbons, layered necklaces, or bags in the signature color palette as comfort and interest develop.\n\nWhat does \"kei\" mean in Japanese fashion terminology?\n\nIn Japanese fashion contexts, \"kei\" roughly translates to \"style\" or \"type,\" indicating a specific aesthetic category or subculture. Kei fashion terms like \"jirai kei,\" \"gyaru kei,\" or \"lolita kei\" use this suffix to denote distinct styling approaches with their own rules, communities, and cultural significance. Understanding this terminology helps navigate Japanese fashion subcultures with appropriate cultural awareness.\n\nDo practitioners need to be Japanese or live in Japan to participate in jirai kei authentically?\n\nAuthentic participation depends more on cultural respect, community engagement, and genuine appreciation than geographic location or ethnic background. International practitioners can participate meaningfully by learning about origins, supporting authentic voices within the community, and approaching the style with appropriate cultural sensitivity. The global Jirai community includes practitioners from diverse backgrounds who contribute positively to cultural development.\n\nWhat's the difference between Jirai Kei and other Japanese fashion subcultures?\n\nJirai distinguishes itself through its unique blend of kawaii and gothic elements, an emphasis on emotional authenticity, and community-driven development via digital platforms. While sharing some aesthetic elements with Gothic Lolita and Decora styles, Jirai addresses contemporary concerns about mental health awareness, digital identity, and authentic self-expression, reflecting the current cultural context rather than historical fashion movements.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nJirai kei fashion represents far more than a trend—it's a cultural movement that transforms personal vulnerability into artistic expression while building supportive communities around shared aesthetic values. The style's careful balance of kawaii cuteness with gothic darkness creates a unique visual language that resonates with individuals seeking authentic ways to express emotional complexity.\n\nFor those interested in exploring Jirai fashion, success depends on understanding both its aesthetic elements and cultural significance. This means learning proper styling techniques while respecting the community values and cultural origins that give the movement meaning. The emphasis on authenticity over perfection creates space for personal interpretation within established frameworks.\n\nThe style's integration of plus-size inclusivity and accessibility through online communities demonstrates fashion's potential for genuine inclusivity when driven by community values rather than commercial considerations. This accessibility ensures that Jirai can continue serving a diverse range of participants while maintaining its cultural integrity and authentic community connections.\n\nCitations:\n[1] \nhttps://dokodemo.world/en/feature/344/\n[2] \nhttps://www.lolitainside.com/blogs/lolita/the-fascinating-blend-of-cute-and-dark-in-japanese-fashion-jirai-kei\n[3] \nhttps://www.yokogaomag.com/editorial/jirai-kei\n[4] \nhttps://www.tokyoweekender.com/art_and_culture/fashion/jirai-kei-fashion/\n\nShare\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare\n\nTweet on X\n\nPin it\n\nPin on Pinterest\n\nicon-left-arrow\n Back to Blog\n\nicon-X\n\n\"Close (esc)\"\n\nicon-X\n\nicon-chevron\n\nicon-X\n\nJirai Kei Fashion: Full Guide to Japan's Dark Feminine Style", "language": "lang_en", "country": "us"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jor%C5%8Dgumo", "title": "Jorōgumo - Wikipedia", "text": "Jorōgumo - Wikipedia\n\nJump to content\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nMythical creature in Japanese folklore\n\nThis article is about the mythological creature. For Jorō-gumo, the spider, see \nJoro spider\n.\n\nJorōgumo from the \nGazu Hyakki Yagyō\n by \nToriyama Sekien\n.\n\nJorōgumo\n (\nJapanese\n: \n絡新婦 \n(\nkanji\n)\n, じょろうぐも \n(\nhiragana\n)\n) is a type of \nyōkai\n, a creature of \nJapanese folklore\n. It can shapeshift into a beautiful woman, so the kanji that represent its actual meaning are \n女郎蜘蛛\n (\nlit.\n \n'\nwoman-spider\n'\n); the kanji which are used to write it instead, \n絡新婦\n (\nlit.\n \n'\nentangling newlywed woman\n'\n) have a \njukujikun\n pronunciation that is related to the meaning, but not the sound of the word. In \nToriyama Sekien\n's \nGazu Hyakki Yagyō\n, it is depicted as a spider woman manipulating small fire-breathing spiders.\n\nJorōgumo can also refer to some species of spiders, such as the \nNephila\n and \nArgiope\n spiders. Japanese-speaking entomologists use the \nkatakana\n form of \njorōgumo\n (\nジョロウグモ\n) to refer exclusively to the spider species \nTrichonephila clavata\n, and this has been adopted into English as \"Joro spider\".\n\nStories\n[\nedit\n]\n\nIn Edo period writings such as the \nTaihei-Hyakumonogatari\n (\n太平百物語\n) and the \nTonoigusa\n (\n宿直草\n), there are \"jorogumo\" that shapeshift into women.\n[\n1\n]\n\nTonoigusa\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\"Things That Ought to be Pondered, Even in Urgent Times\" (\"Kifunaru Toki mo, Shian Aru Beki Koto\", 急なるときも、思案あるべき事) relates the story of a young woman appearing to be about 19 or 20 years old who appears to a youthful warrior (bushi). She tells the child she carries \"That there surely is your father. Go forth, and be embraced\" (\"arenaru wa tete ni temashimasu zo. Yukite idakare yo\", あれなるは父にてましますぞ。行きて抱かれよ). The warrior sees through her ploy and, realizing she is a yōkai, strikes her with his sword, making her flee to the attic. The next day, they find a dead jorōgumo one or two \nshaku\n long in the attic, along with numerous bodies of people that the jorōgumo had devoured.\n[\n2\n]\n\nTaihei Hyakumonogatari\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\"Magoroku Jorōgumo ni Taburakasareshi Koto\" (孫六女郎蜘にたぶらかされし事) from the \nTaihei Hyakumonogatari\n\n\"How Magoroku Was Deceived by a Jorōgumo\" (\"Magoroku Jorōgumo ni Taburakasareshi Koto\",孫六女郎蜘にたぶらかされし事) relates the story of Magoroku dozing in his veranda in Takada, \nSakushu\n (now \nOkayama Prefecture\n). As he was about to doze off, a woman in her 50s appeared. She said that her daughter had taken a fancy to Magoroku and invited him to her estate. There, a 16- or 17-year-old girl asked him to marry her. Already married, he declined, but the girl persisted. She claimed that he had almost killed her mother two days before, and yet she still visited him, and surely he could not let her feelings come to nothing. Bewildered, Magoroku fled. The house disappeared as he ran and he found himself back on his own porch. Magoroku's wife then assured him that he had been sleeping on the veranda the whole time. Concluding it was only a dream, Magoroku looked around and noticed a small \njoro spider\n that had made a tight web around the eaves. Relieved, he recalled how he drove away a spider two days before.\n[\n3\n]\n\nLegends by area\n[\nedit\n]\n\nThe Jōren Falls of Izu\n[\nedit\n]\n\nAt the \nJōren Falls\n of \nIzu\n, \nShizuoka Prefecture\n, allegedly lives the jorōgumo mistress of the waterfall. The local legend tells of a man who rested beside the waterfall basin when the jorōgumo tried to drag him into the waterfall by throwing webs around his leg. The man transferred the webbing around a tree stump, which was dragged into the falls instead of him.\n[\n1\n]\n\nAfter that, people of the village dared not venture close to the falls anymore. Then one day, a visiting woodcutter who was a stranger to this all tried to cut a tree and mistakenly dropped his favorite axe into the basin. As he tried to go down to fetch his axe back, a beautiful woman appeared and returned it to him. \"You must never tell anyone what you saw here\", she said. Initially he kept the secret, but as days went by, the need to spill the story burdened him. And finally at a banquet, while drunk, he told the whole story. Feeling unburdened and at peace, he went to sleep, but he never woke again.\n[\n4\n]\n In another version, the woodcutter was pulled outside by an invisible string and his corpse was found floating the next day at the Jōren Falls.\n[\n5\n]\n\nIn yet another version, the woodcutter fell in love with a woman he met at the waterfall. He visited her every day, but grew physically weaker each time. The \noshō\n of a nearby temple suspected that the woodcutter was \"taken in by the jorōgumo mistress of the waterfall\", and accompanied him to chant a sutra. When a spider thread reached out to the woodcutter, the oshō let out a thunderous yell, and the thread disappeared. Now knowing that the woman was actually a jorōgumo, the woodcutter still persisted and tried to gain permission for marriage from the mountain's \ntengu\n. When the tengu denied him the woodcutter ran towards the waterfall, where he was entangled by spider threads and disappeared into the water.\n[\n6\n]\n\nKashikobuchi, Sendai\n[\nedit\n]\n\nVarious areas have a legend about people being dragged into a waterfall by a jorōgumo as well as the use of a tree stump as decoy. In the legend of Kashikobuchi, \nSendai\n, a voice was heard saying, \"clever, clever\", (\"kashikoi, kashikoi\"), after the tree stump was pulled into the water. The legend is thought to be the origin of the name Kashikobuchi or \"clever abyss\".\n[\n1\n]\n[\n7\n]\n The jorōgumo of Kashikobuchi was worshipped for warding off water disasters, and even now there are monuments and torii that are engraved with \"Myōhō Kumo no Rei\" (妙法蜘蛛之霊).\n[\n7\n]\n\nOnce, an eel that lived in the abyss visited the man Genbe and shapeshifted into a beautiful woman. She warned him that the jorōgumo of the abyss was going to attack her the next day. The woman claimed she could never match the jorōgumo in power and she desired help from Genbe. Genbe promised to help her, but the next day he got scared and shut himself in his house. The eel lost her fight with the jorōgumo, and Genbe died of insanity.\n[\n8\n]\n\nIn fiction\n[\nedit\n]\n\nThe main villain in \nDarkness Unmasked\n by \nKeri Arthur\n is a Jorōgumo in \nMelbourne\n. She kills female musicians, takes on their likeness, and performs in clubs to feast and mate with unsuspecting males. The dead musicians act as food for her children.\n\nA very young Jorōgumo child is the focus of a one-episode \nOVA\n made in 2012 by Toshihisa Kaiya and Daishirou Tanimura, titled \nWasurenagumo\n (\nLi'l Spider-Girl\n). Many years ago she was sealed away in the book by her own caretaker – the priest who defeated her monstrous mother but had no heart to kill the yokai child. In modern-day \nLi'l Spider-Girl\n is accidentally released from the book by a young girl named Mizuki, and then is taken in by the current owner of the book – Suzuri. Later on, Mizuki and Suzuri embark on a short adventure to help their new yokai charge in finding her mom.\n\nIn the novel \nMagic for Nothing\n by \nSeanan McGuire\n (book 6 in the \nInCryptid\n series), a Jorōgumo disguised as a human performer is traveling with a carnival, feeding on locals. The protagonist Antimony Price is sent to investigate the deaths.\n\nIn \nDemon Slayer\n, Spider Demon (Mother) (蜘蛛鬼「母」, Kumo Oni (Haha)) has the design of a woman with a short, curvaceous physique and voluptuous figure, and the ability to control her victims using her threads, which are attached by small white and red spiders, pulling inspiration from the Jorōgumo.\n\nIn \nOne Piece\n, Black Maria, a member of the Beast Pirates, has eaten the Spider-Spider Fruit: Rosamygale Grauvogeli Model and modified it for only her lower half to change into a large spider. She is also a courtesan and musician who keeps many men captive.\n\nIn two books of \"The Hellequin Chronicles\", by Steve McHugh, Jorōgumo are mentioned. In the novella \"Infamous Reign\" Nate fights two daughters and a mother, supposedly killing all three, although the mother's death isn't confirmed. In \"Lies Ripped Open\" he encounters the mother again and kills her definitively that time. Jorōgumo venom is potent and can take several weeks for someone to heal, which requires constant magic use.\n\nIn \nMonster Hunter Rise\n, the monster Rakna Kadaki is a giant fire-breathing spider based on the Jorogumo. It fights alongside its larvae.\n\nIn \nYo-kai Watch Shadowside\n series, Lady Arachnia, is one of the main major villains. She has abilities to captures the whole skyscrapper with all the humans inside using her web, draining all of their souls and leaving them as withered husks of themselves.\n\nIn \nRise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n one of the main villains is Big Mama. She first appears as a beautiful woman, but is then revealed as a \nyōkai\n, with her real form being a huge spider. She repeatedly tricks and manipulates the male protagonists.\n\nIn \nDigimon Story: Cyber Sleuth\n The story mission \"Living Doll, Dead Person\" centers around people being turned into ultra-realistic dolls manufactured by Jorōgumo Co.\n\nAlma Katsu’s 2022 novel, “The Fervor”, takes place partly in a Japanese Internment Camp in Idaho where a mysterious illness is befalling prisoners. A mysterious ghostly woman haunting the neighboring area is in fact a Jorōgumo.\n\nIn the crime mystery anime \nCase Closed\n and its manga, there is a three-part episode, \"Tottori Spider Mansion Demon\" (episodes 166-168) which depicts a series of supposed suicides by hanging. The incidents may be linked to the curse caused by a Jorōgumo. When the protagonists go to investigate, a man is brutally murdered, hung, and his corpse entangled in a massive spider's web. The stakes are raised when one of the main characters finds themselves in the spider's web.
