So I've come across the term landmine or mine woman when looking through \nwear.jp\n today (I'm a fan of Japanese fashions). It was a tag on someone's outfit, so I clicked it and girly and goth style coords popped up. I also saw the term several weeks ago when looking at Japanese makeup videos (the girl was going a dark girly style of makeup). What exactly does this term mean? When I googled 地雷女 a bunch of dating advice articles popped up saying this is the type of woman to avoid. But it seems like an extreme stereotype and not an actual personality type. Also, girls seem to be labeling themselves/ their style with this term, but I'm not sure if they're doing it unironically or not. Is this term just a joke or is it kind of insulting (like otaku)?\n \n\n Note: I don't know how to read katakana or hiragana, I just use google translate when searching things in Japanese.\n \n\n Read more\n \n \n\n \n\n Archived post.

As \"landmine\" is almost always used in negative context towards a person and to harass or demean, there has been controversy surrounding the name.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\n While the term has seen some use in Japanese media as a sales point, it is still seen as derogatory to the degree that the staff of various companies refuse to work on anything related to the term or trend.\n[\n6\n]\n\nWomen within the subculture are called \"Jirai Joshi\" (地雷女子), or landmine girls, while men in the subculture are referred to as \"Jirai Danshi\" (地雷男子), or landmine boys.\n\nOrigins and Controversy\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nDue to a makeup challenge by Japanese YouTuber SuReRo\n[\n7\n]\n that went viral during the March 2020 corona restrictions in Japan, which was about emulating the \"landmine woman\" stereotype, the term has been associated with various darker styles, gradually morphing into its own subculture.\n[\n8\n]\n\nJirai Kei has strong associations with some darker or disturbing themes, though not in the style on its own like \nYami Kawaii\n. In this case, Jirai Kei may be associated with self-harm, drug abuse, alcoholism, street partying, illegal sex work, and other rebellious and shocking behaviors. The associations of this kind of behavior with Jirai Kei is said to have its roots among the Toyoko Kids - a criminal gang mainly consisting out of teenage runaways that is active in Kabukicho, furthering its negative connotations.\n[\n9\n]\n Many criticize that Jirai Kei has contributed to harmful real life consequences, such as teens and young adults being groomed into self-destructive behavior in order to get accepted within the subculture.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\n\nThere's also arguments to be made for the supposed appropriation of the \"landmine\" stereotype by both Japanese and overseas followers of Jirai Kei as solely a fashion trend. Elements commonly associated with the stereotype are often emulated and romanticized as a quirky gimmick solely for aesthetic reasons.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n13\n]\n Meanwhile, those who engage in substance usage, self-harm, and sex work face criticism and demonization from others into Jirai Kei, especially overseas netizens, who wish to renounce them after accusations of Jirai Kei promoting problematic behavior by outsiders.\n[\n14\n]\n In response, some contend that Jirai Kei followers who engage in problematic behavior, labeled as \"lifestyle landmines\", are the true originators of the subculture and therefore should not be disowned from the community solely for the sake of maintaining the reputation of those who insist on only participating in the associated aesthetics of the subculture, labeled as \"fashion landmines\".\n\nDue to the controversies related to the Jirai Kei subculture, people both within Japan as well overseas have stated that it should be no longer promoted in reference to styles and trends as its the fashion part is already mostly encompassed in \nDark Girly\n and \nYami Kawaii.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n15\n]\n\nStyle Basics\n[\n]\n\nJirai Kei as a style has a strong focus on the overall styling rather than the clothes on their own, and therefore the fashions worn can vary to a high degree depending on the current common trends within the subculture.\n\nClothes\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStyles commonly worn by Jirai girls over the years.\n \n \nSince the initial boom in 2020, Jirai Kei has expanded into multiple directions and now covers a wide range of styles. The classic Jirai Kei outfit features \nGirly\n fashion and emphasizes a feminine yet mysterious aura with a focus on the color combination of black with muted pink, but occasionally also red or white.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n16\n]\n High collared blouses are being worn with a frilly high waist skirt and the clothes are often accented with lace and frills.\n[\n1\n]\n An alternative winter version of the style swaps the frilly blouse with a lacey sweater. Gemstone jewelry often includes rhinestones and pearls. Some of the most popular platform shoe choices are platform loafers and, more commonly, Mary Jane platform clogs (both are usually chosen from around 3 inches to 5 inches of back heel length). Lace trim socks or dark tights are be worn under the shoes.\n\nAs the initial look associated with Jirai Kei became mainstream, it started to move on to edgier alternative fashion looks.\n[\n3\n]\n The outfits of this type are generally unisex and often incorporate oversized \nYami Kawaii\n tops with their typical prints, the most popular being depictions of sick or injured stuffed animals, that are worn like a dress and reach a little below the thigh area. There's also many \nGoth Punk\n elements with ripped sweaters, bondage elements, fishnet tights, and massive platform shoes.\n[\n17\n]\n Tracksuits are also occasionally worn in combination with leg warmers or loose socks. Black is still in the central focus for the clothes but with vibrant colors such as red, blue, or purple, as accents. \n\nHair and Makeup\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nTypical \"namida bukuro\" makeup.\n \n \n\nJirai Kei makeup often resembles a highly exaggerated version of byojaku makeup with the typical pink or red under eye blush, emphasized tear bags, down-turned black eyeliner, and overall pale makeup foundation. Black circle lens contacts are commonly worn to make the eyes appear bigger, lipstick colors can vary based on how the wearer decides.\n[\n1\n]\n\nFor hairstyles, hime cut bangs, twin-tails with the ends curled (also referred to as pigtails), and black hair with highlights are most common, though many Japanese Jirai girls also dye strands of their hair to a darker pink color, or use colored extensions. Cute nail art (black and white being the most common colors) with gems and 3D art are also usually seen, especially incorporating Sanrio themes.\n\nAccessories\n[\n]\n\nCommon accessories in Jirai Kei include long black satin hair bows, Miu Miu bracelets, variants of the saturn logo necklace from Vivienne Westwood, a Jill Stuart handbag or MCM logo backpack in pale pink, as well as various types of Sanrio character accessories, most often featuring the characters My Melody or Kuromi.\n[\n1\n]\n Miss Dior perfume bottles are also vastly popular and a common perfume choice. Older adult women invested in the fashion sense can also seen drinking various types of alcohol, like \"Strong Zero\" with a straw, presumably to not disturb their makeup.\n[\n13\n]\n\nAttitude\n[\n]\n\nOn top of the style standing out, Jirai Kei also has a unique attitude of wanting to be in charge, or pushing to be seen and recognized. This slightly rebellious attitude is often seen in those who wear the style; underage high school girls can be seen smoking, drinking, and wandering city streets at night as part of this behavior. It also has ties to even darker themes, such as public promotion of self harm and underage prostitution (see the above \nControversy\n section).\n\nPopularity\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nManga cover featuring Yua Takahashi from \"Tomorrow, I'll Be Someone's Girlfriend\" (明日、私は誰かのカノジョ)\n \n \n\nDespite Jirai Kei being a younger and controversial subculture, it has seen some rise in popularity. Particularly, it has been covered by online magazines who reported about celebrities taking part in the initial makeup challenge, as well as featured by Japanese influencers and beauty gurus who created makeup tutorials for archiving the various looks.\n[\n8\n]\n During the height of its popularity, Jirai Kei's initial style has also been worn by the popular Japanese model Tsubasa Masuwaka, and she described it as \"cute with a gothic edge\".\n[\n18\n]\n\nAlthough it hasn't gained much media traction overseas, Jirai Kei has been mentioned a bit in various English media.\n[\n8\n]\n There also has been a slight increase of general awareness about the subculture due to the drama adaption of the manga \"Tomorrow, I Will Be Someone's Girlfriend\" with the character \"Yua\" representing both the stereotype as well as the style. Music featuring Jirai Kei characters has also become popular in the mainstream, with songs such as DECO*27's \"The Vampire\" featuring Hatsune Miku dressing and acting as a landmine girl reaching nearly 70M views as of late 2023.\n[\n19\n]\n\nBrands & Shops\n[\n]\n\nAnk Rouge\n\nAmilige\n\nBubbles\n\nDarrdy\n\nDearMyLove\n\nLafary\n\nLiz Lisa\n\nMA*RS\n\nNoemie\n\nReflem\n\nRojita\n\nSubcul Zirai\n\nTravas Tokyo\n\nViviene Westwood\n\nYosuke USA\n\nGallery\n[\n]\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n↑ \n1.0\n \n1.1\n \n1.2\n \n1.3\n \n\"Appearing all over Kabukicho!

It is primarily associated with young people frequenting the nightlife of Kabukichō. Initially, the style closely resembled the darker variant of \nJapanese Girly\n fashion during its peak popularity, but it has since evolved to incorporate a wider range of styles.\n\nThe subculture carries a stereotype: young women who adopt this cute, hyperfeminine yet dark fashion are perceived to have personalities that contradict their appearance. Instead of being sweet and demure, they are often stereotyped as violent and obsessive (akin to a \nYandere\n), engaging in self-harm, and having habits of heavy drinking or smoking.\n\nJapanese brands have rapidly adapted to this trend, with Western brands influenced by Kawaii culture also following suit.\n\nContents\n\n1\n \nHistory\n\n2\n \nVisuals\n\n3\n \nFashion\n\n3.1\n \nTops\n\n3.2\n \nBottoms\n\n3.3\n \nShoes and Legwear\n\n3.4\n \nAccessories\n\n3.5\n \nHair and Makeup\n\n4\n \nMedia\n\n4.1\n \nLiterature\n\n4.2\n \nManga\n\n4.3\n \nTelevision\n\n4.4\n \nVideo Games\n\n5\n \nMusic\n\n5.1\n \nSongs\n\n5.2\n \nPlaylists\n\n6\n \nCriticism\n\n7\n \nResources\n\n7.1\n \nBlogs\n\n7.2\n \nVendors\n\n8\n \nGallery\n\n9\n \nReferences\n\n10\n \nNavigation\n\nHistory\n[\n]\n\nThe term \"Jirai Kei\" is derived from \"\nJirai Onna\n\" (地雷女), literally \"landmine woman,\" a derogatory term used to stereotype women, particularly those with mental illnesses such as Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), bipolar disorder, and other mood swing-inducing conditions, as a \"ticking time bomb.\" This term is often employed to dismiss women, frequently ex-girlfriends, as \"crazy\" or \"dangerous\" based on arbitrary traits, such as an affinity for kawaii aesthetics. Within the subculture, women are referred to as \"\nJirai Joshi\n\" (地雷女子), or \"landmine girls,\" while men are called \"\nJirai Danshi\n\" (地雷男子), or \"landmine boys.\"\n\nThe subculture became associated with various darker fashion styles following a \"psycho girlfriend\" dress-up challenge that gained viral traction during the March 2020 COVID-19 restrictions in Japan.\n[\n1\n]\n This challenge frequently referenced traits commonly associated with the Toyoko Kids, a group primarily composed of young runaway teenagers, some of whom were groomed online by older men with promises of a better life in the Kabukicho red-light district. These individuals are often exploited for sex work, drug trafficking, and other criminal activities.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\n\nWhile Western followers of Jirai Kei often attempt to separate it from its darker origins by viewing it solely as a fashion trend, the subculture largely retains a negative public image within Japan. Its associations with the \"psycho girlfriend\" trope are interpreted as a misogynistic stereotype, yet Japanese girls who identify as \"landmine\" fully embrace it.\n[\n4\n]\n This misunderstanding stems from several factors: the language barrier hindering accurate interpretation of Japanese articles and social media posts, a lack of awareness regarding the perception of mental health issues in Japan, and brands capitalizing on the subculture's popularity by using \"Jirai Kei\" as a marketing term, regardless of whether their products are genuinely associated with it.\n\nVisuals\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExample of a heavily edited selfie by @hiudayonn.\n \n \n\nGirls in this subculture add \nheavy filters and edits\n to their photos. Pale pink and white filters can add a slight haze to all of their images, and they are often decorated in \nvirtual stickers\n with Jirai Kei motifs. They also use \nface and body editing\n to the point of an unnatural appearance. Impossibly large eyes with anime proportions, making skin more pale, and making their bodies thinner and longer are extremely common in photos. This is with the goal of appearing eerie and puppy-eyed, diverging from the trend of \"pien\" makeup on Japanese tiktok. The color palettes of Jirai Kei is mainly white, black and pastel pink, though on occasion red, blue and grey is also used. \n\nTo contrast all of the sweet and girly visuals, violent imagery is often shown. \nBox-cutters, razors, and pockets knives\n are commonly featured in outfit posts. The stereotype is that a landmine girl would use it to threaten her boyfriend if he upsets her, or that she engages in self-harm. Additionally, these cute girls often pose with \nfake guns\n (firearms are illegal in Japan), cigarettes, or \nalcohol and energy drinks\n (from Strong Zero and Monster Energy) with straws, presumably to protect their lipstick while drinking. Many photos have color-scheme matching energy drink cans, and it is even popular to stack and glue the cans in the shape of machine guns. Similar to Yami Kawaii, there is often medical imagery of \npills and syringes\n, usually paired with narcotics and synthetic drugs. \n\nSanrio is strongly associated with the \nKawaii\n, girly, and consumer culture in Japan. As a result, girls into Jirai Kei are also associated with these characters, specifically \nKuromi\n and My Melody\n. People in this subculture own and take photos of plushies of these characters and own an assortment of merchandise, such as backpacks, pencil pouches, etc. themed around these characters. Sanrio has taken notice and even released Jirai Kei-inspired plushies of Kuromi and My Melody. Another character that can be associated is Menhera-chan, the suicidal magical girl that popularized \nYami Kawaii\n. Her artist has drawn her in stereotypical outfits, and her self-destructive habits could be relatable for those in the subculture. \n\nThere's also many artists engaging with the subculture who draw \nanime-style illustrations\n of landmine girls wearing the typical outfits while in stereotypical situations, such as taking selfies, holding a can while squatting on the streets, or having a mental breakdown. Jirai Kei followers often repost these \ndrawings on social media\n. \n\nFashion\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe various styles worn by jirai girls illustrated featuring Blue Archive characters. \n \n \n\nThe styles associated with Jirai Kei are constantly changing with the core defining trait being that the fashion is worn by landmine girls. Comparable to \nE-Girl\n’s style, while landmine girls may wear many different fashion styles, there is a main look typically associated with the aesthetic that evolved out of a mix of several different alternative genres. The initial look associated with the Jirai Kei subculture derived from \nJapanese Girly fashion\n and \nYami Kawaii\n, however outfits consisting out of \nGoth Punk\n, \nJersey Maid\n, and darker general \nalternative\n fashion have also been popular among its followers. As the trends within Jirai Kei keep on changing, many brands mimic one another and release mix-and-match variations for the various styles worn. The fabric of the clothes tends to be on the more synthetic side, with the quality not being that high, on account of them often being made by fast fashion companies who constantly adopt to the latest trends. \n\nRegardless of the style worn, the idea is to appear cute yet mature, but with an dark aura. \n\nThe ultra-feminine Jirai style has also evolved since its inception. As the style developed, the details of the style increased, with certain trends being more or less popular as certain garments from specific brands became viral. \n\nTops\n[\n]\n\nThe most common tops are \nblouses with ultra-feminine details\n that may slightly resemble \nLolita Fashion.\n Peter Pan and sailor collars, ruffles, lace trim, puffed sleeves, cold-shoulders, contrasting buttons are some tropes that are featured in the blouses. Alternative outfits use coat-dresses instead, and winter outfits utilize knit sweaters. Girls also often \ntie ribbons or add bow brooches with rhinestone or pearl-accented faux jewels\n at the neck. \n\nSome brands have also released \noversized tees and sweatshirts\n that can fit in with this aesthetic. They often have a print with a stereotypical motif, English text, anime prints, etc. These also contain feminine details, but less often. For example, there may be eyelets for lacing ribbon through, zippers, or detachable Peter Pan collars. This resembles the fashion of the \nYami Kawaii\n aesthetic, and contributes to an edgier and less girly look. Jirai boys add masculine or androgynous elements to this style, while girls like to pair these tops with chunky sneakers and necklaces. \n\nA trend that appeared approximately 2023 is the set-up, which is a two-piece set consisting of a \ntunic-length top with a matching pair of micro-shorts\n, with the aim of it looking like an extra-short dress, with the shorts being for modesty purposes. This top would have the same details as the blouses. \n\nBottoms\n[\n]\n\nHigh waisted mini skirts\n are by far the most popular bottom. The silhouette can be flared, trapezoid or pleated. \nSilver hardware details\n such as heart-shaped belt buckles, eyelets, and zippers add edge to the outfit and contrast the lace and girly details of the blouse. But there are also ruffles, ribbon lacing to resemble a corset, and ruffled suspenders to add girliness. \nShorts\n can also be featured in this aesthetic, as well as \nlonger flowy skirts\n. However, they are both comparatively rare to the mini skirts. Usually the bottoms are black while the top is pink or white, though sometimes this is flipped. \n\nThe more casual \nJersey Maid\n and \nYami Kawaii\n inspired looks can also have \ntrack pants\n like ones from Adidas as a pairing with a track suit jacket or oversized tee or sweatshirt. \n\nShoes and Legwear\n[\n]\n\nBecause the legs are most often exposed in this style, \nlace or fishnet stockings\n are worn, and could be switched or even doubled up with \nruffled or lace ankle socks\n. \n\nThe shoes are most commonly \nplatform loafers or multi-strapped mary janes\n, and most girls buy their shoes from BUBBLES Tokyo, DearMyLove, Liz Lisa and others. The shoes can be \nmore decorated,\n with faux jewels, ribbon laces, rhinestone buckles and silver cross charms. \n\nAccessories\n[\n]\n\nThe most popular bags are \ntotes and mini backpacks\n. Usually, they're pink or black, sometimes adorned with ribbons and bows with plushies or Sanrio figurine keychains attached. The most popular mini backpacks on social media are the studded MCM mini packpack and Melody Maison de Fleur totes. Other girls may instead use bags from \npopular luxury brands\n.\n\nAside from ribbons and bows, there is not much jewelry involved in Jirai Kei. Most styles include only earrings or neckwear like chokers, piercings and necklaces. A popular trend is the Viviene Westwood orb necklace. Because of the color scheme, many girls avoid gold jewelry and opt for silver.\n\nHair and Makeup\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAn illustration of the typical hairstyles by \nAkagumi-chan\n.\n \n \n\nHime-cut bangs,\n which are straight bangs across the forehead with side bangs around chin-length, are extremely popular amongst young women in Japan in general as it is an easy way to archive the illusion of a small face. It fits in with the ultra-feminine style. Because these women are Japanese and around high school age, the \nmost common hair color is black\n, since dyed hair is not allowed in schools. However, some girls add \nhighlights that can be bleached blonde or in different shades of pink.\n\nIn terms of styling, \npigtails\n (also called twin tails), are the majority hairstyle. They can be either low or high, with high pigtails often being \nhalf-up half-down\n. Girls often curl the ends and decorate these twin tails with \nribbons and bows\n, often with the same faux jewels on their brooches. Other \nhair accessories\n such as rectangle headdresses, headbands with faux jewels, and bobby pins with charms are popular too. \n\nFor the eye makeup, the most popular is an exaggerated version of the \"\nnamida bukuro\n\" makeup style where the \ntear bags\n are emphasized to look puffy as if the wearer is about to cry, which is further highlighted with pink undereye blush. The additional effect of appearing sickly is also desired. The \neyeliner is downturned to give a more \"puppy-like\"\n , feminine and sad appearance. \n\nFace and lip makeup are equally pink, with \nblush and sparkly highlighter being high\n on the cheekbones. \nLip makeup has a wide variation\n, with some looks being more matte, some glossy, some sculpted, some even. \n\nMany additional cosmetic products are also used for exaggerated features. \nFake lashes\n are generally popular in Japan, and in Jirai Kei, they are longer and spikier. \nDark circle lenses\n are also popular, and serve to make the eyes look bigger and anime-like. \n\nLong acrylic nails\n are also popular and often feature lace patterns, faux jewels, corset lacing, crosses, as well as stereotypical motifs like the pleading face emoji. \n\nMedia\n[\n]\n\nLiterature\n[\n]\n\nHost Madness\n - Oizumi Rika\n\nKabukicho Moratorium\n - Chiwawa Sasaki\n\nPeople Who Overdose\n - Chiwawa Sasaki\n\nThe Disease of Pien: Consumption and Approval of the SNS Generation\n - Chiwawa Sasaki\n\nManga\n[\n]\n\nAshita, Watashi wa Dareka no Kanojo - Tomorrow, I'll Be Someone's Girlfriend\n\nAndroid wa Jirai-kei no Yume wo Miru - Android Dreams of a Jirai Kei Girl\n\nKiken na Ren'ai - Dangerous Love\n\nKimi ni Aisarete Itakatta - It Hurts To Be Loved By You\n\nJirai Kareshi - My Boyfriend's a Ticking Time Bomb\n\nJirai-kei JK to Onee-chan no Hanashi - The Landmine Girl and Her Sister\n\nJirai Ninja Ruru no Shitsuren - Jirai Ninja Ruru's Heartbreak\n\nKakaKano - Dating the Kind of Girl You Shouldn't Get Involved With\n\nKoi wa Jirai wo Funde kara - A Love That Begins After Stepping On A Mine\n\nMitame Jirai-kei Osananajimi - My Childhood Friend Looks Like A Landmine But Isn't\n\nYamaarashi no Shisha (ヤマアラシのシーシャ)\n\nZenma (銭麻)\n\nTelevision\n[\n]\n\nAshita, Watashi wa Dareka no Kanojo\n\nCinderella Complex\n\nIshiko and Haneo: You're Suing Me?\n (episode 7)\n\nThe Black Swindler (episode 8)\n\nVideo Games\n[\n]\n\nJIRAIYA\n\nNeedy Streamer Overload\n\nSentimental Deathloop\n\nSuteki na Kanojo no Tsukurikata\n\nYandere ura Kano Jirai-chan\n\nYamikore\n\nLove Angel Syndrome\n\nMusic\n[\n]\n\nSongs\n[\n]\n\nAlice*Iris - Daikirai Lie Suki\n\nAlice*Iris - Gimme Me Love\n\nAmu - Pien Syndrome\n\nAmu - Mekka Warning\n\nCagayake - Unleash\n\nChilldspot - Ai Ai\n\nDECO*27 - The Vampire\n\nIsana - Menhera Janai Mon!\n\nHoneyWorks - Kawaikute Gomen\n\nKuraisekai - So Pien My Life\n\nKAFU - Egonomy\n\nKai - Unicorn Girl\n\nKai - Lose the Princess\n\nKairiki Bear - Darling Dance\n\nKareki Kashiwagi - Ikayaki-Wristed Girl\n\nLiLiPi - Shukipi Overdose\n\nMagnetite Hiiragi feat.

There are strong associations with mental illness, self harm, drug usage, sex work, underage prostitution, and other uncomfortable subjects. The negative aspects of the \"landmine\" stereotype are often emulated and romanticized as a quirky gimmick solely for aesthetic reasons.\n[\n5\n]\n On Twitter in particular, it's not uncommon for followers of the subculture to constantly promote self-destructive behaviour, the accounts often being part of \nshtwt\n (self-harm twitter) and \nedtwt\n (eating disorder twitter).\n[\n4\n]\n There's also a strong association with \"bangya\" culture with landmine girls also being stereotyped as groupies who are obsessive over their favorite bands and music artists to an unhealthy degree.\n\nAnother problem is the fetishization of the \"landmine\" stereotype, which is a glimpse into the wider topic of sexualizing women who exhibit mental illness. It is problematic for its ableist rhetoric claiming mentally-ill women to be \"freaky\", \"hot but crazy\" and more desirable sexually and emotionally, as well as its infantalistic undertone of these women being more emotionally attached and dependent on their lover's affection.\n[\n6\n]\n This fetishization of mentally ill women and use of the femme-fatale archetype ignores the unpleasant nuances of suffering from BPD or bipolar disorder and targets women who are mentally vulnerable to emotionally abusive, power-imbalanced relationships.\n[\n7\n]\n\nThere also have been issues caused by the strong associations with the host culture of Kabukicho. As people of any age can enter those establishments as long as no alcohol is served, male hosts have been actively going for young girls to spend money on them in exchange for affection, often resulting in the girls resorting to \"papa katsu\" (sugar-daddying) in order to afford their host club addiction.\n[\n8\n]\n\nBecause the clothes worn are often very brand specific, some Jirai Kei netizens suggest that there is slight elitism in the community for purchasing items from the \"correct\" stores, regardless of if the price can be prohibitively expensive, particularly for western followers that endure high shipping fees from Japanese brand proxies. On social media, especially on TikTok, some argue that this brand-focused side of Jirai Kei encourages hyper consumerism and trend-cycling while the same is also said for those who buy cheap replica items from problematic fast fashion stores like Shein/Romwe. \n\nAs the subculture can't be separated from its problematic parts precisely because they are what make Jirai Kei what it is, many have argued that its name shouldn't be used in a throwaway manner in reference to styles or trends in order to not expose strangers to potential triggering content. \n\nResources\n[\n]\n\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\nFor further reading, please read its \npage\n on the Jfashion Wiki. \n\nBlogs\n[\n]\n\nZirai Bijyo\n\nSubcul Zirai\n\nZirai Zyoshi\n\nVendors\n[\n]\n\nAnk Rouge\n\nAmilige\n\nBubbles\n\nDarrdy\n\nDearMyLove\n\nLafary\n\nLIZ LISA\n\nMA*RS\n\nNoemie\n\nReflem\n\nRojita\n\nSubcul Zirai\n\nTravas Tokyo\n\nViviene Westwood\n\nYosuke USA\n\nGallery\n[\n]\n\nキャンメイク縛り地雷メイク【イエベ・茶髪OK】\nA makeup tutorial\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n↑\n \nAbsolutely the largest eyes!!

What does \"Seiso-kei Joshi\" mean? A guide to \"○○-kei Joshi/Danshi (girl/guy)\" based on personality and fashion\n\nUpdated on\n Aug 21, 2025\n\nPublished on\n Mar 22, 2025\n\nAuthor\n\n Yukari\n \n\nEditor\n\n Cody Ng\n \n\n # Japanese Culture\n \n\n # Fashion\n \n\n LIKE\n \n\nHave you ever heard terms like \"Himono Onna\" or \"Fujoshi\" in Japanese dramas and anime? These phrases have evolved, and in recent years, more variations of \"○○-kei Joshi\" and \"○○-kei Danshi\" have emerged, such as \"Jirai-kei Joshi,\" \"Minato-ku Joshi,\" and \"Nikushoku-kei Danshi.\" In this article, we will introduce some of the most commonly used \"○○-kei Joshi/Danshi\" in Japan, explaining their meanings and characteristics in terms of personality and \nfashion\n. Which type do you belong to?\nPersonality Type ①: What is \"Jirai-kei Joshi\"? What is \"Intelli-kei Danshi\"?\n地雷系女子 (Emotionally volatile girl) / ぴえん系女子 (Cutesy and clingy girl)\n\n \n\"Jirai-kei Joshi\" is characterized by dark-colored outfits and bold makeup. Their emotions tend to be unstable, with dramatic mood swings, which is why they are called \"Jirai-kei\" (\"landmine-type\"), reflecting their explosive emotional tendencies. They are highly sensitive and easily hurt, but they also have deep affection. Once they open their hearts to someone, they become deeply devoted.\n \nサバサバ系女子 (Cool and independent girl)\n\n \n\"Saba-saba-kei Joshi\" refers to women who have a straightforward and carefree personality, showing little interest in others in a good way. They dislike flattery, speak their minds openly, and have an independent mindset. However, there is also a type often ridiculed as a \"self-proclaimed Saba-saba-kei Joshi.\" These individuals tend to have a strong need for validation, often talking about themselves excessively.\n \n理系男子 (Science guy)\n\n \n\"Rikei Danshi\" refers to men who studied science and engineering subjects in school or have a logical, analytical way of thinking. They excel at approaching things rationally and tend to be calm and composed, with little emotional fluctuation. Since scientific fields require perseverance and precision, many of them are also diligent and detail-oriented. On the other hand, their deep focus on tasks can lead them to prioritize work over relationships, sometimes isolating themselves in their own world.\n \nインテリ系男子 (Intellectual guy)\n\n \n\"Intelli-kei Danshi\" are men with extensive knowledge and education, exuding an intellectual and refined aura. They are known for their composed speech and sophisticated demeanor and enjoy engaging in intellectual and logical discussions. However, the term can also be used mockingly to describe men who boast about their intelligence and knowledge.\n \nこじらせ男子 (Socially awkward guy)\n\n \n\"Kojirase-kei Danshi\" refers to men who have unique obsessions or biases about romance and relationships, often overthinking things in a negative way. Their personalities can be extreme, either having a high sense of pride or an exceptionally low self-esteem, making it difficult for them to develop romantic relationships. Despite this, they often have a sensitive and easily hurt inner side.\n \nPersonality Type ②: Food-based Personality Types – \"Nikushoku-kei,\" \"Soushoku-kei,\" and more\n肉食系女子・肉食系男子 (Go-getter in relationships)\n\n \nThis term describes people who take an assertive approach in romance and relationships. \"Nikushoku-kei Joshi\" are confident and proactive in love, often making the first move. They are comfortable with physical touch, openly expressing affection, and are not afraid to confess their feelings. \"Nikushoku-kei Danshi\" have a masculine, ambitious, and positive personality. They actively ask for contact information, invite people out for meals, and take the lead in dating situations.\n草食系女子・草食系男子 (Passive in dating)\n\n \nIn contrast to \"Nikushoku-kei (Go-getter in relationships),\" these individuals are passive or reserved when it comes to romance. \"Soushoku-kei Joshi\" are quiet, gentle, and shy, often taking a passive role in relationships. Similarly, \"Soushoku-kei Danshi\" do not actively pursue romantic interests and are usually not overly focused on love. They tend to prioritize their hobbies and personal interests over dating, valuing their own time above all.\n \nロールキャベツ系女子・ロールキャベツ系男子 (Looks shy but actually bold in love)\n\n \nA middle ground between \"Nikushoku-kei (Go-getter in relationships)\" and \"Soushoku-kei (Passive in dating).\" These individuals may appear passive at first but are actually quite assertive in relationships. \"Roll Cabbage-kei Joshi\" seem demure on the outside but are bold and proactive in love, unafraid to make their feelings known. \"Roll Cabbage-kei Danshi\" often have a refreshing and mild outward appearance, but when alone with someone they like, they show a more masculine and assertive side, actively pursuing the person they are interested in.\n \n絶食系女子・絶食系男子 (Romantically detached)\n\n \nUnlike \"Nikushoku-kei\" or \"Soushoku-kei,\" these individuals have no interest in romance at all. \"Zesshoku-kei Joshi\" do not dislike men or struggle with relationships; they simply prefer to focus on themselves and their personal lives rather than dating. \"Zesshoku-kei Danshi\" have the same mindset—they see romance as unnecessary and prioritize other aspects of life. However, both tend to have many friends and are often good at socializing.\n \nPersonality Type ③: Animal-based Personalities – \"Puppy-like,\" \"Cat-like,\" and More\n犬系女子・犬系男子 (Puppy-like personality)\n\n \nPeople with a \"puppy-like personality\" are affectionate and expressive, much like dogs. \"Puppy-kei Joshi\" are bright, cheerful, and incapable of telling lies, embodying a pure-hearted nature. However, they can also be clingy and skilled at seeking attention when they feel lonely. Similarly, \"Puppy-kei Danshi\" have an innocent and friendly disposition, often radiating warmth with their smiles. In relationships, they are devoted to their loved ones, remaining loyal and affectionate, just like a dog that follows its owner faithfully.\n \n猫系女子・猫系男子 (Cat-like personality)\n\n \nA \"cat-like personality\" refers to people who are independent and dislike being tied down, much like cats. \"Cat-kei Joshi\" are known for their \"tsundere\" nature, switching between being aloof and affectionate. They value freedom but will approach others when they want attention or affection. \"Cat-kei Danshi\" dislike rigid rules and prefer acting on their own terms rather than following group norms. Since they cherish their personal space, they tend to prioritize alone time.\n \nウサギ系女子・ウサギ系男子 (Bunny-like personality)\n\n \nPeople with a \"bunny-like personality\" are sensitive to loneliness and crave attention, much like rabbits. \"Bunny-kei Joshi\" are particularly sensitive to being alone and excel at showing their affectionate side. \"Bunny-kei Danshi\" have a gentle and endearing presence, often taking great care of their appearance, which gives them a clean and well-groomed look. Though initially shy, once they open up to someone, they become affectionate and may even show a slightly spoiled side.\n \nキツネ系女子・キツネ系男子 (Fox-like personality)\n\n \nIn Japan, foxes are often seen as cunning and elusive creatures, so a \"fox-like personality\" describes someone mysterious and hard to read. \"Fox-kei Joshi\" are thoughtful and observant, making them excellent at reading the room and anticipating others' needs, often being perceived as perceptive and considerate. \"Fox-kei Danshi\" are serious and cautious, preferring stability over major changes. Like their female counterparts, they are skilled at understanding social dynamics, making them good at interpersonal relationships.\n \nタヌキ系女子 (Raccoon-like personality)\n\n \n\"Tanuki-kei Joshi\" have a warm and approachable aura, creating a relaxing atmosphere for those around them. A defining feature is their round and soft facial features, often with large, expressive eyes. Their gentle and easygoing nature makes them naturally sociable and considerate, making them well-loved by both men and women.\n \nゴリラ系男子 (Strong and tough guy)\n\n \nDue to their strong and powerful image, \"Gorilla-kei Danshi\" are known for their physical and mental toughness. They are often found in athletic or sports-oriented circles, characterized by their disciplined and hardworking nature. They are serious, well-mannered, and push themselves to the limit. While they hold themselves to high standards, they also have a kind heart and a surprisingly sensitive side.\n \nAppearance and \nfashion\n: Neat girls, street boys, etc.\n清楚系女子 (Elegant and modest girl)\n\n \nPeople with a \"Seiso-kei\" style are known for their simple and refined appearance. They prefer modest outfits in white, pastel, or other soft tones, avoiding excessive exposure. Their makeup is natural, and their hair is often long, dark, and glossy. Their personality tends to be calm and polite, leaving an impression of femininity and elegance.\n \n量産型女子 (Cookie-cutter girl)\n\n \n\"Ryosan-gata Joshi\" refers to women who embrace the latest trends in \nfashion \nand makeup, often following popular styles. Because they adopt widely trending looks, their appearance tends to resemble others with similar \nfashion \nchoices, leading to the term \"mass-produced\" (Ryosan-gata).\n \n美魔女 (Timelessly beautiful woman)\n\n \nA term coined by \nfashion \nmedia, \"Bimajo\" refers to women aged 35 and older who maintain a youthful glow. They not only focus on their external beauty but also cultivate inner elegance through their life experiences.\n \n森ガール (Forest girl) \n\n \n\"Mori Girl\" describes women who wear loose, natural clothing that hides their body lines, resembling an ethereal presence in a forest. This style peaked around 2009.\n \n塩顔男子 (Delicate and cool-looking guy)\n\n \nMen with a \"shio-gao\" face have thin eyes, pale lips, and delicate nose lines, giving them a refreshing and clean look. They often have an androgynous aura, a slim physique, and prefer hairstyles like a tousled natural look or a mushroom cut.\n \n爬虫類系男子 (Reptile-like guy)\n\n \nMen with a \"hachu-rui gao\" (reptilian face) have wide-set eyes, a well-defined nose bridge, and a sharp, triangular face shape. Their skin is usually fair and translucent, with prominent lips. These unique features give them an enigmatic and mysterious charm.\n \nメガネ女子・メガネ男子 (Glasses-wearing girl/guy)\n\n \nMen and women who wear glasses are often perceived as intelligent and serious. The type of frames can greatly influence their impression, and many wear \"fake glasses\" as a \nfashion \nstatement.\n \nストリート系女子・ストリート系男子 (Street-style girl/guy)\n\n \nPeople who favor street \nfashion\n, including sneakers, caps, and hoodies, inspired by hip-hop and skater culture. The oversized and loose silhouettes, along with unisex designs, make it a popular choice for expressing individuality across various age groups.\n \nぽっちゃり系女子・ぽっちゃり系男子 (Chubby but cute girl/guy)\n\n \nIndividuals with a rounder physique who are often seen as kind, warm, and comforting. The positive perception of \"Pocchari-kei\" has led to the rise of \"chubby idols\" and \"plus-size models\" in Japan.\n \nHobby-Based Personalities: Minato Ward Women (Glamorous Tokyo socialite), Hipster Guy, and More\n港区女子 (Glamorous Tokyo socialite)\n\n \nWomen who frequent luxurious areas of Minato Ward, such as Roppongi, Azabu, and Akasaka.

Statements consisting only of original research should be removed.\n \n(\nJanuary 2025\n)\n (\nLearn how and when to remove this message\n)\n\nJapanese street fashion\n refers to a number of styles of contemporary modern clothing in \nJapan\n. Created from a mix of both local and foreign fashion brands, Japanese \nstreet fashions\n tend to have their own distinctive style, with some considered to be extreme and \nimaginative\n, with similarities to the \nhaute couture\n styles seen on European \ncatwalks\n.\n\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\n\nAs early as the 1950s, there were a few brands specially catered to street fashion, such as \nOnitsuka Tiger\n (now known as \nASICS\n).\n\nIn addition, the emergence of strong youth culture in the 1960s and 1970s that continues today (especially in \nHarajuku\n, a district in Shibuya, Tokyo) drives much of the development of new styles, looks, and fashion subcultures. The rise of \nconsumerism\n, which played an important part in Japan's \"national character\" during its economic boom in the 1980s, continues to influence fashion purchases, even after this economic bubble burst in the 1990s. These factors result in the swift turnover and variability in styles popular at any one time.\n[\n1\n]\n\nIn 2003, \nJapanese hip-hop\n, which had long been present among underground Tokyo's club scene, influenced the mainstream fashion industry.\n[\n2\n]\n The popularity of the music was so influential that Tokyo's youth imitated their favorite hip hop stars from the way they dress with oversized clothes to tanned skin.\n[\n3\n]\n\nThough extremely popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, many trends experienced a levelling off in the later 2000s and onwards; the rise and fall of many of these trends had been chronicled by \nShoichi Aoki\n since 1997 in the fashion magazine \nFruits\n, which was a notable magazine for the promotion of street fashion in Japan.\n[\n4\n]\n\nFashion industry and popular brands\n[\nedit\n]\n\nComme des Garçons garments on display at the \nMetropolitan Museum of Art\n\nAlthough Japanese street fashion is known for its mix-match of different styles and genres, and there is no single sought-after brand that can consistently appeal to all fashion groups, the huge demand created by the fashion-conscious population is fed and supported by Japan's vibrant fashion industry. \nIssey Miyake\n, \nYohji Yamamoto\n and \nComme des Garçons\n are often said to be the three cornerstone brands of Japanese fashion. Together they were particularly recognized as a Japanese fashion force in the early 1980s for their intensive use of \nmonochrome\n color and cutting-edge design.\n\nThe social motives driving interaction with and involvement in personal fashion choices and wider fashion movements within Japan are complex. Firstly, the comparatively large quantity of disposable income available to Japanese youth is significant; many argue this has been, historically, made possible through a greater degree of Japanese youth living at home with their parents for much longer than in other countries, reducing living expenses and thus making larger spending on clothing possible.\n[\n5\n]\n\nJapan is also known for its significant consumption of foreign luxury brands. According to data from 2006, Japan consumed 41 percent of the entire world's \nluxury goods\n.\n[\n6\n]\n The blue line of \nBurberry\n is among the most successful in this arena.\n\nJapanese street fashion influences the \nWest Coast of the United States\n.\n[\n7\n]\n High-end fashion brands like \nComme des Garçons\n have played a big role in the global industry since the 1980s, especially through frequent cross-over guest design with other brands. In 2008, \nRei Kawakubo\n designed for \nLouis Vuitton\n[\n8\n]\n and \nH&M\n.\n[\n9\n]\n Harajuku Fashion was ranked 5th in the fashion field of Google Search of the Year in 2019.\n[\n10\n]\n\nModern Japanese street fashion\n[\nedit\n]\n\nThough the styles have changed over the years, street fashion is still prominent in \nTokyo\n today. Young adults can often be found wearing subculture attire in large urban fashion districts such as \nHarajuku\n (\nUra-Harajuku\n), \nAoyama\n, \nGinza\n, \nOdaiba\n, \nShinjuku\n and \nShibuya\n.\n\nLolita\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nLolita fashion\n\nSweet Lolita (left) and Gothic Lolita (right)\n\nContaining many different themes within its boundaries, Lolita has become one of the larger, more recognizable styles in Japanese street fashion and has gained a following worldwide. Skirts or dresses are usually worn at or below knee length with petticoats beneath for volume. Blouses or tops are lace-trimmed or ruffled in the Victorian or Rococo style. The length of the socks or stockings can go from ankle to thigh level and may be topped with lace. Wearers of this fashion style often put on \nMary Janes\n, tea party shoes, or boots. The more well-known sub-styles within Lolita fashion are as follows:\n\nGothic Lolita - Lolita with a heavy influence from the Eastern and Victorian Goth style. Often characterized by dark colors and accessories adorned with motifs such as skeletons, bats, spiders, and other popular gothic 'icons', such as characters from \nTim Burton\n films. Victorian iron gates and architectural designs are also often seen in dress prints. Bonnets, rectangle headdresses, and brooches are popular accessories for Gothic Lolita.\n\nSweet Lolita - the most childlike style, mostly characterized by baby animals, fairy tale themes, and innocent, childlike attire. It was originally inspired by Victorian children's clothing and the \nkawaii\n culture that is very prevalent in Japan. Pastel colors are often used, although some dresses or skirts may feature darker or muted colors as well. Large head bows, cute purses, and stuffed animals are popular accessories for Sweet Lolita.\n\nClassic Lolita - a sub-style more closely resembling the historical fashion of the Rococo or Victorian eras. The colors that are used in this look are usually muted, thus giving this sub-style a more mature feel. Floral prints and solid colors are common, although fancier prints are not unheard of as well. Small head bows, bonnets, rectangle headdresses, and hair corsages are popular accessories for Classic Lolita.\n\nPunk Lolita - an experimental style, mixing the influences of Punk with Lolita. It can sometimes look deconstructed or crazy while keeping most of the 'Lolita silhouette'.\n\nOuji - also known as 'boy style', are the more masculine counterparts of lolita, influenced by Victorian boys' clothing. 'Prince pants', which are short capri-style pants that are cut off the knee, usually with some sort of detail (such as lace-edged cuffs) are commonly worn with masculine blouses, top hats, knee socks, and other accessories.\n[\n11\n]\n\nGyaru\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nGyaru\n\nGyaru\n being photographed in \nIkebukuro\n in 2009\n\nGyaru\n (sometimes known as \nGanguro\n, actually a subcategory of \ngyaru\n), is a type of Japanese street fashion that originated in the 1970s. \nGyaru\n focuses on girly-glam style, dwelling on man-made beauty, such as wigs, fake lashes, and fake nails. \nGyaru\n is also heavily inspired by Western fashion.\n\nGanguro\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nGanguro\n\nTwo \nganguro\n girls in Tokyo, April 2008\n\nThe \nGanguro\n style of Japanese street fashion became popular among Japanese girls in the early 1990s and peaked in the early 2000s. \nGanguro\n falls into the larger subculture of \ngyaru\n fashion. \nGanguro\n typically includes brightly colored outfits, mini-skirts, and tie-dyed \nsarongs\n. The \nganguro\n style consists of bleached hair, a deep tan, fake eyelashes, black and white eyeliner, bracelets, earrings, rings, necklaces, and platform shoes.\n\nMany people consider \nNamie Amuro\n to have been the leading figure of \nganguro\n style. Exactly after her public appearances with tanned skin and dyed hair, a lot of Japanese girls started to follow her example. The terms \n\"Yamanba\"\n and \n\"Manba\"\n refer to the extreme ends of the \nGanguro\n style. However, enthusiasts of both the \nYamanba\n and \nManba\n styles consider \nganguro\n as an \"easy version\" of their style. Nowadays, the name \n'Yamanba'\n has shortened to \n'Manba'\n. \n\n[\n12\n]\n\nKogal\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nKogal\n\nA \nkogal\n identified by her \nloose socks\n and shortened skirt\n\nThe \nKogal\n (\nKogyaru\n) look is based on a high school uniform, but with a shorter skirt, \nloose socks\n, and often dyed hair and scarf as well. Members of the \nKogal\n style sometimes refer to themselves as \nGyaru\n (gals). This style was prominent in the 1990s, and it started gaining popularity again at the end of 2020, however it is an age category specifically for gals in high school.\n\nBōsōzoku\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nBōsōzoku\n\nJapanese \ncosplayers\n dressed up in \nbōsōzoku\n-style outfits\n\nWhile \nbōsōzoku\n fashion has not been widely popular since the 1990s, the stereotypical \nBōsōzoku\n look is often portrayed, and even caricatured, in many forms of Japanese media such as anime, manga, and films. The typical \nbōsōzoku\n member is often depicted in a uniform consisting of a \njumpsuit\n like those worn by manual laborers or a \ntokko-fuku\n (\n特攻服\n)\n, a type of military issued over-coat with \nkanji\n slogans. These are usually worn open, with no shirt underneath, showing off bandaged torsos and matching baggy pants tucked inside tall boots.\n\nAmekaji\n[\nedit\n]\n\nAmekaji is a style based on American casual, often narrowly defined as Western/Native American/Biker-based. Amekaji was introduced to the public in the early 1990s by a group of delinquents in \nShibuya\n known as \"Teamer\". Later, it was popularized by \nTakuya Kimura\n who wore it in his TV dramas.\n\nDecora Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nExample of Decora fashion\n\nThe \nDecora Kei\n style originated in the late 1990s/early 2000s and rose to great popularity both in and outside Japan. It is exemplified by singer \nKyary Pamyu Pamyu\n, who rose to prominence in the \nHarajuku\n fashion scene before her musical debut. The wearers usually stick to a color scheme for their decora, such as Pink Decora, Red Decora, Dark Decora, and Rainbow Decora. A plain shirt and hoodie were often worn with short \ntutu\n-like skirts. The hair (often worn in low ponytails with long bangs) and make-up itself tend to be quite plain. However, the most significant part of \nDecora Kei\n is to pile on many layers of cute accessories until the bangs and front hair is barely visible. Stockings, legwarmers, arm warmers, and knee socks are also worn over each other in different layers. Common details also include \nleopard prints\n and patterned \ndental masks\n. The style has since decreased in popularity but still has a large following worldwide.\n\nVisual \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nVisual Kei\n\nVisual \nkei\n band \nVersailles\n\nVisual \nKei\n is a subculture created in the mid-1980s by Japanese musicians consisting of striking makeup, unusual hair styles, and flamboyant costumes, similar to Western \nglam rock\n and \nglam metal\n. \nAndrogyny\n is also a popular aspect of the style. Some of the more well-known and influential artists of the style include \nX Japan\n, \nLuna Sea\n, \nVersailles\n, \nThe Gazette\n, \nMejibray\n, \nRoyz\n, \nL'Arc-en-Ciel\n, \nAn Cafe\n, \nMalice Mizer\n, and \nDiaura\n.\n\nOshare Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nOshare Kei\n is the opposite side of Visual \nKei\n, with bright colors and many pop impressions. This said, bands under this style live up to the meaning by dressing up in colorful costumes, or in \nDecora\n or \nPop Kei\n style; many are seen sporting large amounts of jewelry and bags of anime characters and animals slung on, many colorful hairclips, and lighter make-up. The music is more happy sounding, the lyrics lighter and happier. Bands include \nAn Cafe\n, \nPanic Channel\n, Ichigo69, Lolita23q, \nSug\n, Delacroix, \nLM.C\n, and Aicle.\n[\n13\n]\n\nAngura Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nAngura Kei\n is a dark Japanese fashion that is often associated with a subgenre of \nVisual Kei\n. The term derives from the Japanese pronunciation of \"underground\", which refers to its origins in underground theater. The clothes tend to be heavily influenced by traditional Japanese elements as well as the \nShowa era\n (1926–1989) but with a Goth spin to it. The make-up usually consists of \nshironuri\n and is dark and heavy. While kimono is the most commonly used by visual \nkei\n artists, the style also often features modified Japanese school uniforms. Motifs and accessories are themed around post-war Japan and the occult.\n\nCult Party \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nCult Party \nKei\n, named after the Harajuku shop \nCult Party\n (now known as the \nVirgin Mary\n), is a style that was popular around the early 2010s and is based on Western religious artifacts like crosses or bibles. Common aspects include crosses wired in yarn, layers of fabric in soft colors, lots of cream lace and satin bows. The make-up and hairstyle is not as over the top as other styles. Cult Party \nKei\n is often worn with natural-looking make-up without any larger emphasis on the eyes and simple hair-dos with roses. Cult Party \nKei\n is considered by some to be a subset of Dolly \nKei\n.\n\nDolly \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nDolly \nKei\n is a style based on Japan's view of the \nMiddle Ages\n and European \nfairy tales\n, especially the \nBrothers Grimm\n and \nHans Christian Andersen\n. It includes a lot of vintage-style clothing and sometimes has religious symbols. \nGrimoire\n is a store in Japan that has been described as \"the pioneering store behind the Dolly-\nkei\n fashion scene\".\n[\n14\n]\n\nFairy \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nFairy \nKei\n is a youthful style based on 1980s fashion that evokes a dreamy, nostalgic feeling. Outfits are made up of pastel colors, angels, toys and generally cute motifs and elements and accessories from Western toy lines of the 1980s and early 1990s, such as \nPolly Pocket\n, \nMy Little Pony\n, \nStrawberry Shortcake\n, \nRainbow Brite\n, \nPopples\n, \nLady Lovely Locks\n, \nBarbie\n, \nWuzzles\n, and \nCare Bears\n. Pastel-colored hair is common, although natural hair is also popular, and hairstyles are usually kept simple and decorated with anything cute or pastel; bows are a common theme. Some common items used in a Fairy Kei coordinate include vintage sweaters, cardigans, varsity jackets, tutus, mini skirts, tights, over-the-knee socks, sneakers, and tea party shoes. The term \"Fairy \nKei\n\" originated from the magazine called \nZipper\n (despite a common belief that Sayuri Tabuchi [Tavuchi], the owner of Tokyo fashion store \nSpank!\n, was the accidental creator of the style).\n[\n15\n]\n\nGirly \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nGirly \nKei\n is a hyperfeminine Japanese fashion style that emphasizes cute and girlish appearance. As opposed to the definition in English, Girly Kei does not generally only consider everything feminine and mature looks; Girly Kei tends to focus on lace, ribbons, ruffles, and patterns such as flowers and hearts, with soft and pastel colors such as pink being the main focus. There are many substyles and the popular image can vary depending on the current trends has pushed Girly Kei's evolution into a more hyper-feminine and innocent direction during the early 2020s because mainstream fashion trends took heavily from this style.\n\nMori Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMori Kei\n (\nmori\n meaning \"forest\") uses soft, loosely fitting layers of garments such as floaty dresses and cardigans. It places an emphasis on natural fabrics (\ncotton\n, \nlinen\n, \nwool\n) and hand-made or vintage accessories with a nature theme. The color scheme tends to be light and neutral, but patterns such as gingham and florals may also be used. In terms of hairstyles, bangs (often curled) and braids are very popular. The style is similar to Dolly \nKei\n in that the aim is to create a doll-like appearance but in a more casual, earthy manner.\n[\n16\n]\n\nJirai Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nA \nHatsune Miku\n cosplayer wearing Jirai Kei\n\nJirai Kei is the edgier counterpart to the aforementioned Girly Kei fashion style. Jirai Kei, literally meaning \"landmine type\", is a fashion subculture originating from Japan's \nKabukichō\n and spread in popularity in the early 2020s, which incorporates \ndark\n and \nkawaii\n styles. Described as similar to \nLolita\n and \nPreppy\n fashions in clothing, it's often paired with accessories with bow, heart, \ncross\n, and lace elements, and wear \nplatform shoes\n. The primary colors in Jirai Kei are black, white, and pale pink. It highlights femininity, cuteness, and fosters a sense of loveliness with the perfect balance of cool. The stereotype behind this subculture is that cute, hyper-feminine young women who dress in darker fashion styles have personalities that do not match their appearance. Rather than being sweet and kind, they are said to be violent and obsessive.\n[\n17\n]\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n\nGirly fashion has a wide range of different clothing types, like Girly Kei, Jirai Kei fashion has been met by widespread social prejudice, directed towards those who wear Jirai Kei and their lifestyle choices not just about being what western society thinks of as feminine. It highlights lace, ribbons, ruffles, and playful patterns like hearts, with soft pastel pinks as the main focus, perfectly balanced by striking blacks.\n[\n18\n]\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n\nPeeps\n[\nedit\n]\n\nPeeps is a 90s-inspired sporty goth style that has been popularized in Harajuku's underground scene by the online magazine \nPEEPS\n. It was voted one of the major trends for 2020 in the yearly trend forecast by the Japanese women's magazine \nMery\n.\n[\n19\n]\n\nKimono style\n[\nedit\n]\n\nDespite the widespread nature of Western clothing in Japan, Japanese fashion is still influenced by traditional clothing, with people still wearing the \nkimono\n in daily life, though most people wear it only for weddings, graduations, and other formal occasions.\n\nDespite the heavily reduced numbers of people wearing kimono as everyday clothing, the younger generation in Japan can still be seen to mix kimono and modern style in fashion, wearing modern footwear and accessories instead of the typical \ngeta\n and \nkanzashi\n usually worn. There are even modern designers who have used the kimono as inspiration, such as the \"TANZEN\" collection from designer Issey Miyake.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n\nGenderless\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nGenderless fashion in Japan\n\nIn the mid-2010s, genderless fashion became widespread and focused on people wearing clothing that did not conform to their gender. The subculture is mostly dominated by men, who are known as \"genderless men.\"\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n\nDesigners featured at international fashion weeks\n[\nedit\n]\n\nTomoko Yamanaka's work was featured at \nLondon Fashion Week\n, 2010.\n[\n20\n]\n\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\n\nDeconstruction (fashion)\n\n2000s in Japanese fashion\n\n2010s in Asian fashion\n\nYouth culture\n\nCamp (style)\n\nFruits\n\nCuteness in Japanese culture\n\nMadam/Aristocrat\n\nElegant Gothic Aristocrat\n\nNeo-Victorian\n\nCosplay\n\nVisual Kei\n\nPoupee Girl\n\nBaby, the Stars Shine Bright\n\nGyaru\n\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n\n^\n \nGodoy, Tiffany (December 2007).

{"url": "https://yumemipi.wordpress.com/2020/05/29/oshi-terms-101-a-guide/", "title": "Oshi Terms 101 : A Guide – Yumemipi's Outlet ♥", "text": "Oshi Terms 101 : A Guide – Yumemipi's Outlet ♥\n\nSkip to content\n\nIf you’re a beginner in the idol scene, wotaku community, or maybe someone who’s curious about these things, it gets confusing because there are a lot of terminologies and slang that are flying around across the internet.\nI remember being really clueless and had little to no idea of what these meant until I talked to some of my japanese friends (who are also into 2d idols) and they walked me through the whole experience and of course, did some research on my own as well. Though there are a lot of words and the list just goes on and on, I chose the basic ones and what I think would be interesting for everyone to know!\n\nNow the big question:\n WHAT THE HELL IS AN OSHI?\n\n• Oshi (推し/おし)\n\n– the word oshi literally means\n “push”\n but it is now the common term used for people who is a fan of something or someone.\n– can also be referred to a person who likes a group or a person who likes a certain member.\n– also commonly known as \n“stan/bias”\n in western fan terms.\nExample:\n私はABC推しです ➡️ (I am a fan of ABC)\n推しはAさん➡️ (The person I am a fan of is A-san)\n***Do note that the word ‘Oshi’ is widely used not only in the idol scene but also actors, voice actors, anime/game characters and so much more!***\n\n• \nTan-Oshi (単推し/たんおし)\n\n– term used for someone who’s only loyal to one person or member.\n– this is also popularly known as \n“Top Oshi”\n\n• Hako-Oshi (箱推し/はこおし)\n\n– literally means \n“Box Push”\n– it is the term use to liking all members of a group.\nTo simply break it down:\n箱 (hako) ➡️ the whole group\n推し (oshi) ➡️ support\n\n• Oshi Kaburi (推し被り)\n\n– this refers to having the same oshi as an another fan.\n\n•\n DD\n\n– means “\nD\naredemo \nD\naisuki”\n– this refer to fans who doesn’t have one favorite member in a group but rather loves multiple members of the group.\n– also most commonly known as “multi-fandom”.\n\n• Wotaku (ヲタク)\n\n– it is mostly abbreviated as \nヲタ\n which means fan.\nファン\n (fan) is the common mainstream term. BUT!!\nヲタク\n (wotaku) has more deeper feel than being just a ‘fan’.\nAn example situation for Fan VS Wotaku:\nFan ➡️ “He is handsome. I like him.”\nWotaku ➡️ “He is so handsome!!! I’M CRYING I LOVE HIM SO MUCH!!! Ahhh ;;; “\n//That kind of feeling! LOL\n\n• Onna wota-wota (女ヲタヲタ)\n\n– means “Female fan’s fans” //I know sounds weird.\n– this term is referred to someone who does not like the idol/group but rather who likes their female fans instead.\n– mostly seen going to the live concert site not to watch and support the idols but to see their female fans. YIKES. PLS ALWAYS BE CAREFUL!\n\n• Gachi-koi (ガチ恋/がちこい)\n\n– means falling in love with their oshi.\n– transformed from being just an ordinary fan to really want to fall in love with them.\n– this is mostly used by male fans.\n\n• Riako (リアコ)\n\n– it’s a short term for “I’m in real love” / “\nRia\nru ni \nKo\ni shiteru” (リアルに恋してる)\n– Riako and Gachi-koi have similar meanings but this is only used by female fans.\n\n•\n Kenashi Ai (貶し愛/けなしあい)\n\n– this means saying hateful words/hating the person you like but deep inside it is a form of expressing your love for them aka “Playful rudeness”. Much like a Tsundere(??) LOLOL\n– pretty common thing for this is making memes out of their oshi’s /ugly/ faces or expressions.\n\n• Niwaka Ame (にわか雨)\n\n– it is used as a negative connotation for people who became fans only because of a sudden surge of popularity of a certain series/group but then it dies down when the hype is not there anymore aka most commonly known as the “mainstreamers”.\n\nThe “niwaka” is written in kanji as 「\n俄\n」 which means “suddenly”.\nThe word \n‘niwaka ame’\n in japanese means\n ‘rain shower’\n and just like rain showers it pours then it stops. In addition to that, ‘niwaka’ is also an abbreviation for the theatre act called \n“Niwaka Kyogen”\n an on the spot type of play that was held on the streets during Edo period and was very popular during at that time.\nThere is no negative element in the word “niwaka” but the fan term for it is becoming more common nowadays. Please do refrain from using it to other fans!\n\n• MIHA (ミーハー)\n\n– has similar meaning to ‘niwaka’\n– this refers to people who are easily influenced\n– aka follower of new trends\nA situational example for that is when originally, you were not interested in liking this certain group/idol (or even a series) but everyone around you was very into it so you checked it out and became a fan.\nThere are many theories for the etymology of this word so I will present 3 of those!\n1. During Showa Era, there were many young women whose name starts with “mi” (み) and “ha” (は). Those who were called “Mi-chan” and “Ha-chan” are referred to as young women who are obsessed with their hobbies and had little to no educational background. Nowadays, it’s also used thoroughly among men.\n2. It’s a combination of the popular japanese dessert called “Mitsumame” and an old stage name of a well known Showa actor, “Chojiro Hayashi”\n3. It comes from the words “Me” and “Her” in the english language.\n\n• Resu (レス)\n\n– means response\n– refers to the idol’s response to you during events or live concerts, such as waving at you or doing what’s written in your “uchiwa”!\n\n• All Pass (ぜんつう)\n\n– someone who participates in all concerts and activities of their oshi hence the term ‘All Pass’\n\n• Jizou (地蔵/じぞう)\n\n– someone who’s at the event/live concert and just quietly looks at the idols and performers\n– basically motionless\n\n• Kakoi (囲い/かこい)\n\n– someone who’s watching a live stream and spams in the comment section in an attempt to attract the attention of the one who’s broadcasting.\n\n•\n Pile Up (積む積み/つむつみ)\n\n– a fan who bought too many copies of the same cd/merchandise\n– this is very common for fans especially when purchasing \n\n• Number of Goods = Love\n\n– its called\n グッズ量参戦歴 = 愛\n but ofc that wouldn’t make sense when I translate it word by word LOL i think??? don’t sue me pls\n– basically this means “The number of merchandise you have of your oshi/ how many times you participated in concerts = LOVE”\nA gentle reminder that not buying merchs of your oshi’s doesn’t make you less any of a fan! I’ve heard from other’s experiences that they are starving themselves and would rather buy merchs and sacrifice buying their own personal needs. I have totally nothing against buying merchs because if it makes you happy, then go for it. I know the experience all too well since I love collecting and buying merch as well.\nBut PLEASE prioritize your money when you have to!\n\n• Takai (他界/たかい)\n\n– can also mean “another world” or “graduate”\n(Ex: I have graduated from being a fan of this group. )\n– refers to someone who has stopped being a fan due to various reasons.\n\n• Kamitaiou (神対応/かみたいおう)\n\n– aka “God’s Response”\n– refers to an idol who has a good response to fans.\nAn example for this is when an idol reads fanmails from fans and shares his thoughts.\n\n• Shiotaiou (塩対応/しおたいおう)\n\n– basically the opposite of “kamitaiou”\n\n• Hair Make (ヘアメク)\n\n– just as the name suggests, its about styling hair! This is very popular among female fans and they usually go to the salon to make their hair look cute and stylish before a live concert or even when they just hang out with their friends.\nIn hair make you can put your oshi accessories!

{"url": "https://rentablog.org/2023/09/19/japanese-for-nerds-oshikatsu-otakatsu-blkatsu-and-language/", "title": "Japanese for NERDS: Oshikatsu, Otakatsu, BLkatsu, and language – rentaBLog", "text": "Japanese for NERDS: Oshikatsu, Otakatsu, BLkatsu, and language – rentaBLog\n\nSkip to content\n\nAs you may have seen from my posts, I like to sprinkle in a lot of Japanese to help people learn and contextualize the language and culture a majority of our content comes from. While we’re a localization company, I know a lot of people who read manga do intend on eventually learning and hopefully mastering Japanese someday, whether it’s in order to not have to rely on English licenses to get that sweet, sweet content, or even just to be able to comfortably follow Japanese mangaka, publishers, or fan accounts, and it can be helpful to learn bit by bit through your hobbies.\n\nStill in the process of my own Japanese-learning journey (I think most language learning never actually ends, honestly—even in your native language), after living in Japan for four and a half years I’ve found there are a lot of words that’re hard to know without specifically taking part in the cultures surrounding them. The same way, say, Dungeons & Dragons or Genshin or even sports fanbases have their own own vocabulary and phrases that don’t make a lot of sense outside their core community, being a nerd in Japan has its own language that can be a bit difficult to grasp for those not in the know.\n\nA lot of these words take place within 推し活 (\noshikatsu\n, a word that’s hard to translate but is essentially “oshi life”)—the words people use to talk about their favorite characters, idols, artists, etc. The word \noshikatsu\n is a portmanteau (the Japanese language \nloves\n a good portmanteau) of 推し (\noshi,\n or fav, bias, etc.) and 活動 (\nkatsudou\n, activities), so essentially the activities and lifestyle of having an \noshi\n. People who already take part in online or in-person Japanese otaku events likely already know this world well—the world otaku allow themselves to fall into once they’ve finished the dull slog of everyday life. The real world might suck, but at least we have \noshikatsu\n to unwind to and enjoy with friends.\n\nIt’s actually such a common word at this point that it’s not rare to walk in to very average or trendy stores and see an \noshikatsu\n section filled with colorful \nnui\n clothes, things to make \nuchiwa\n, or even just pouches and accessories in colors that are common signifiers of your fav idol or character. (For instance, my favorite character from Genshin is Xiao, so I tend to buy a lot of thing in the teals, greens, and soft purples that make up his color palette.) Trendy bakeries, cake shops, etc.—living an otaku lifestyle is very common and normal, and it’s not rare at all seeing stores and brands catering to it.\n\nNonetheless, there are still a lot of words that are so highly specific to actually living \noshikatsu\n, \notakatsu\n (“otaku life”), or \nBLkatsu\n (“BL life”) so I’ll introduce some of those words here. (Using Genshin characters and ships for many of my examples, since those are the names I know best lol.)\n\n====================\n\n推し（おし） \noshi\nLet’s start with the easiest and most well-known phrases, but arguably the most important. \nOsu\n sounds similar to “push” but the kanji is different (押す) so the meaning also differs. This version is specific to the act of supporting, backing, or endorsing something. \nOshi\n is the noun version. It can be used like “Xiao is my \noshi\n!” but also “I am Xiao-\noshi\n!”\n\n単推し（たんおし）\ntan’oshi\nTan’oshi\n (not to be mistaken for 楽しい/\ntanoshii\n) isn’t super different from \noshi\n, but it’s a specific word used for when you like a group, but there is one member of the group you \nspecifically\n really really really love—your fav \nwithin\n a group that you like.\n\n箱推し（はこおし）\nhako’oshi\nHako’oshi\n is kind of the opposite of \ntan’oshi\n. \nHako\n means “box” so essentially you like a group as a full package and don’t particularly have a specific favorite member—you love everyone equally! \n\n====================\n\nオタク　\notaku\nEveryone knows this. Even non-otaku know this. But I wanted to include it to point out it’s actually a very common word, and doesn’t have the negative connotation that’s often pushed in the West. Anyone can be an otaku—it just means having an intense interest in something, from trains to idols to fashion to animals.\n\n腐女子（ふじょし）\nfujoshi\n“Ames, do you really think we don’t know what \nfujoshi\n means?” I’m sure everyone who reads this already knows this word, but it also felt wrong to leave it out of this section. For those who don’t know, \nfujoshi\n is an otaku who is specifically interested in BL content, whether in an “original content” sense or a “shipping” sense. \nFujoshi\n does NOT just mean a female otaku; some have tried to claim it as such but always get shot down by the larger community. (See also: 腐男子/\nfudanshi\n which is the male version, and \nfujin\n, the gender-neutral term which is exclusive to western spaces.)\n\n姫女子（ひめじょし）\nhimejoshi\nA \nhimejoshi\n is a female fan of GL/yuri! These are people who enjoy GL ships as well as original manga. There are some fans who exclusively prefer GL, but some might like BL and GL equally!\n\n夢女子（ゆめじょし）\nyumejoshi\nAs many know, \nyume\n means “dream.” A \nyumejoshi\n is a girl who prefers to self-insert with the male characters she likes. When she refers to her \noshi\n as her husband, she’s not being ironic or silly. There is sometimes \nsome\n polite crossover between \nfujoshi\n and \nyumejoshi\n but it’s generally not common, since they’re antithetical to each other.\n\nガチ恋（ガチこい）\ngachikoi\nGachikoi\n, or “legit love,” is used to refer to the act of falling in literal, sincere love with your \noshi\n. This is a bit more common in 2.5D and 3D fandoms, but is also possible with 2D. This term is often used disparagingly, since \ngachikoi\n are frequently seen as quite toxic and possessive of their \noshi\n, but it is possible to be a \ngachikoi\n without being weird about it.\n\n====================\n\nボーイズラブ・BL\nIf you don’t know what this is, I’m shocked you somehow made it to this blog. Boys’ Love is the genre name for depictions of male/male romantic and sexual relationships. I’m assuming you’re a fan of this if you’re reading this post. \n\nガールズラブ・GL\nGirls’ Love, perhaps more commonly referred to as yuri, is simply the female version of BL. There doesn’t seem to be much differentiation between yuri and GL the way there is for yaoi and BL, as most Japanese stores use the two names interchangably. \n\nティーンズラブ・TL\nTL is what we refer to on Renta! as “mature romance,” but the actual phrase is “teens love.” In all honesty, I’m not sure why it’s referred to as such, but the name had to be changed for a western market since this is all erotic content aimed at adult women, not teens. \n\nNL・HL\nNL and HL are the words used for het relationships and content. HL obviously stands for “hetero love.” Unfortunately NL stands for “normal love,” but I’ve been told there’s been a move away from this in recent years specifically because it’s rather offensive.\n\n====================\n\n一次創作（いちじそうさく）\nichijisousaku\nIchijisousaku\n can also just be referred to as \nsousaku\n, which is original content. This is not fanart or anything based off an existing series or franchise. The reason \nichi\n is sometimes placed at the front is in case an artist posts both original and derivative works to their account; by tagging it as \nichijisousaku\n it’s easy to differentiate that it’s their original work.\n\n二次創作（にじそうさく）\nnijisousaku\nNijisousaku\n, however, IS content based off an existing series, title, or franchise. This is all fanart, fanfiction, \ndoujinshi\n, and even cosplay content. Sometimes a mangaka will have a \nnijisousaku\n account specifically where they post fanart and such, but sometimes they leave it all in one place.\n\n創作BL（そうさくBL）\nsousaku BL\nAs you may have guessed by now, \nsousaku BL\n refers to original BL, so anything tagged with this uses original characters specific to the artist. This can be both self-published \nor\n commercial content.\n\n商業BL（しょうぎょうBL）\nshougyou BL\nShougyou BL\n, however, refers very specifically to licensed, published, commercial BL works. This means the title is commercially released in stores, and it’s not self-published by the author, or just a short story they wrote for social media. This is a useful tag for tracking down new titles and releases to look out for.\n\n====================\n\n沼（ぬま）\nnuma\nNuma\n means “swamp” or “bog.” Have you ever stepped into a swampy marsh and felt it pulling you down? And then it’s hard to pull your foot back out because of the pressure and suction from the mud? That’s \nnuma\n—a semi-joking phrase that means you’ve been dragged down into the filth of a series or character or pairing and now there’s no getting out. This is particularly common when someone is feeling themselves dragged into a new fandom, or trying to convince a friend to get in the “swamp” with them.\n\n====================\n\nジャンル　\ngenre\nDO NOT be fooled by this phrase—it sits firmly in the camp of \nwasei eigo\n, Japanese phrases taken from English that mean something only vaguely related. “Genre” in the \noshikatsu\n sense refers to the series or fandom, \nnot\n the content within (romance, action, scifi, and so on).\n\nI made this mistake once with a Japanese friend who planned on tabling at a \ndoujinshi\n event. She told me she was planning to release a Touken Ranbu book, and I asked “which genre?” and she gave me a weird look and repeated “Touken Ranbu.” Needless to say, I’ll never forget the difference now.\n\n====================\n\n次元（じげん）シリーズ　\n“jigen” series\nJigen\n means “dimension” so these are used to differentiate between fiction and reality…\n2次元（にじげん）\nni jigen\nNijigen\n is the 2D world, where fictional oshi roam. Anime, game, and manga otaku are the lords of the \nnijigen\n, and many of these type of otaku say they’re really only interested in 2D.\n\n3次元（さんじげん）\nsan jigen\nSanjigen\n is often used as slang to refer to the “real world,” the one where humans roam. 2D otaku may often speak disparagingly of “3D” and the things within (similar to phrases like “I’m not interested in 3D men—only 2D!”), but there are also many otaku who like 3D things like idols, musicians, movie stars, etc. A BL mangaka oshi would also be included in here (though it feels weird to phrase it that way).\n\n2.5次元（にてんごじげん）\nni-ten-go jigen\nNi-ten-go\n is the weird space between filled by actors \nplaying\n your fictional oshi, common to stage plays or occasionally drama or movie roles. However, 2.5 can also be used to refer to \nseiyuu\n or VTubers—people who you may like only because they voice your fictional fav, or you know there’s a real human in there somewhere, but you like them based on their fictional, 2D persona. \n\n生もの（ナマモノ）\nnamamono/\nnmmn\nAs was previously discussed in the post all about \nnamamono\n rules and culture, this is the shipping of actual living, breathing, 3D (or 2.5D) humans. \nNama\n means “raw” and \nmono\n means “thing” or “object,” so \nnamamono\n content is content dealing with living organisms. If you want to read more about \nnamamono\n, check out: \n“There’s Fanfiction About Us?”\n\n====================\n\nカップリング　\ncoupling\n“Coupling” (“CP”) or \nkappu\n is just the word for “ship.” \n\n推しカップ（おしカップ）\noshikappu\n / 自カップ（じカップ）\njikappu\nOshikappu\n or \njikappu\n refers to “OTP”—this couple is your ride or die, the one you put all of your time and effort head-canoning and creating content for. \n\n====================\n\n右・左（みぎ・ひだり）\nmigi/hidari\nAs many people who’ve taken beginner Japanese know, \nmigi\n and \nhidari\n simply mean “right” and “left,” so perhaps some of you are surprised to see them on here. But, as I discussed in my post all about \nnamamono\n, \nmigi\n and \nhidari\n refer to which side of the pairing name a character appears on.\n\nIn western fandom, the order of the pairing name seems to matter less than the vibe of how the name sounds i.e. I’ve seen “xiaoven” (the Genshin ship for Xiao and Venti) refer to Xiao topping, Venti topping, or reversible. In Japanese fandom, however, the ordering of the pairing name is serious business, and the character who tops is on the left, and the character who bottoms is on the right i.e. “Do you like ‘xiaoven’ or ‘venxiao’?” Thus, you might see something like 魈右, or “Xiao \nmigi\n,” meaning the person is only interested in Xiao bottom.\n\n固定（こてい）\nkotei\nKotei\n, meaning “fixed” or “anchored,” refers to someone who only likes content a specific way. For instance, if I said I was トマト固定 (\nthomato kotei)\n, referring to the Genshin ship Thoma/Ayato, it would mean not only do I not want to read content of them with other people, but I also don’t want to read the reverse shipping order. I am only 100% specifically interested in Thoma topping Ayato, and Ayato bottoming for Thoma.\n\n総攻め・総受け（そうぜめ・そううけ）\nsouzeme/sou’uke\nSouzeme\n and \nsou’uke\n is the very BL culture version of saying something like \nmigi kotei\n or \nhidari kotei\n—it means in your heart, a character is either 100% seme or 100% uke. It doesn’t matter what character they’re with, but they should only ever top OR only ever bottom. To use Xiao again, for instance, I could say Xiao is \nsou’uke\n to me, meaning he \nnever\n tops, no matter who he’s with.\n\nリバ・逆（リバ・ぎゃく）\nriba/gyaku\nRiba\n and \ngyaku\n refer to couples that are either 100% reversible, or switch occasionally. \nRiba\n is much more common in a genre sense, and is used more commonly in official and original BL. \n\n雑食（ざっしょく）\nzasshoku\nIf Japanese fandom sounds a bit too strict and intense to you, just know that there are also \nzasshoku\n—“omnivores,” which is the word for multishippers and people who aren’t super particular about the ship, who tops or bottoms, etc. as long as the content is delicious.\n\n====================\n\n地雷（じらい）\njirai\nJirai\n means “landmine,” and it’s the word people use to refer to content that they \nvery\n heavily dislike. It’s similar to “squick” in the West, but quite a lot stronger, and often used in the context that if you post a specific type of content, the person will block you, or if a certain type of content is YOUR \njirai\n then you should block them.\n\nA \njirai\n can be as big as “character death” and as seemingly inconsequential as specific ships or characters. It’s content you absolutely don’t want to see for any reason because it irritates you and ruins your day.\n\nSome very common \njirai\n:\n×\n女体化\n（にょたいか）\nnyotaika\n – depicting one or both characters as female\n×\nリョナ \nryona\n – sometimes referred to as “whump” in the west\n×\n固定（こてい）\nkotei\n – anything that goes against their “fixed” preferences\n\n自衛（じえい）\njiei\nJiei\n simply means self-defense, but it’s a strong belief in online communities that a person is in charge of their \nown\n comfort and happiness online. For this reason, blocking, muting, and putting very clear warnings about what one can expect from following your social media is encouraged. It may seem like gatekeeping from the outside, but it’s to avoid fandom in-fighting and policing.\n\n担当（たんとう）\ntantou\nThe \ntantou\n is usually the head or manager of something, so \ntantou\n is used similar to \noshi\n to indicate your fav, but is often more specific to idol series (particularly older ones like Idol Master, Uta no Prince-sama, and Idolish7). It’s similar to saying “I am the manager of xyz idol.” However, unlike with \noshi\n, the phrasing for \ntantou\n is more restrictive—if I said “Xiao is my \ntantou\n” that would be like saying Xiao is my manager. It can only be the other way around. \n\n同担（どうたん）\ndoutan\nDou\n means “same” and \ntan\n is the same from \ntantou\n, so this essentially means you’re managing the same idol. However, this is also just generally used to refer to people who have the same \noshi\n as you. There are two very important versions of this phrase, though:\n　\n同担歓迎（どうたんかんげい）\ndoutan kangei\n　willing/seeking for friends with the same \noshi\n.\n　\n同担拒否（どうたんきょひ）\ndoutan kyohi\n　doesn’t want to associate with people with the same \noshi\n.\n\n垢（あか）\naka\nAka\n literally just means dirt or grime, but it’s a play on words for the shortened version of アカウント (account). \nAka\n refers to someone’s social media account. For instance, one might have an account specifically for talking about Genshin, so 原神専用垢 (\nGenshin senyou aka\n, or “Genshin-specific account”). It’s particularly common, especially previously, to refer to people’s shit-posting or personal accounts with this kanji.\n\n雑多（ざった）\nzatta\nZatta\n just means “misc.” and is thus generally refers to a multi-fandom account. It’s often used in the insinuation “don’t follow me if you’re only interested in _______” since if you follow this type of account after seeing a bunch of cute Xiao fanart, you’ll end up annoyed when they move on to drawing another fandom next week.\n\n====================\n\nAnyway, that’s all for today! I hope you find these interesting, or useful! Sometimes maneuvering JP fandom can be a bit stressful, since the fandom culture is quite different. Culture shock isn’t only for specifically visiting a country anymore, now that the internet has made everything so easy to access.\n\nAre there any words I didn’t include here that you’ve learned specifically from your fandom? Feel free to post them in the comments, since I’m sure someone will find them useful! I know there are a lot of words I left out, since I didn’t have the time or space, and this was meant to be more informative rather than as a glossary. \n\nShare this:\n\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\n\nX\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\nFacebook\n\nLike\n \nLoading...\n\nRelated\n\n \n\n \n\n Published by \names\n \n\n I love BL manga and cats and cool weather. \n\n View all posts by ames \n\n 5 thoughts on “\nJapanese for NERDS: Oshikatsu, Otakatsu, BLkatsu, and language\n” \n\nLoved this!

I also saw the term several weeks ago when looking at Japanese makeup videos (the girl was going a dark girly style of makeup). What exactly does this term mean? When I googled 地雷女 a bunch of dating advice articles popped up saying this is the type of woman to avoid. But it seems like an extreme stereotype and not an actual personality type.

It is primarily associated with young people frequenting the nightlife of Kabukichō. Initially, the style closely resembled the darker variant of \nJapanese Girly\n fashion during its peak popularity, but it has since evolved to incorporate a wider range of styles.\n\nThe subculture carries a stereotype: young women who adopt this cute, hyperfeminine yet dark fashion are perceived to have personalities that contradict their appearance. Instead of being sweet and demure, they are often stereotyped as violent and obsessive (akin to a \nYandere\n), engaging in self-harm, and having habits of heavy drinking or smoking.\n\nJapanese brands have rapidly adapted to this trend, with Western brands influenced by Kawaii culture also following suit.\n\nContents\n\n1\n \nHistory\n\n2\n \nVisuals\n\n3\n \nFashion\n\n3.1\n \nTops\n\n3.2\n \nBottoms\n\n3.3\n \nShoes and Legwear\n\n3.4\n \nAccessories\n\n3.5\n \nHair and Makeup\n\n4\n \nMedia\n\n4.1\n \nLiterature\n\n4.2\n \nManga\n\n4.3\n \nTelevision\n\n4.4\n \nVideo Games\n\n5\n \nMusic\n\n5.1\n \nSongs\n\n5.2\n \nPlaylists\n\n6\n \nCriticism\n\n7\n \nResources\n\n7.1\n \nBlogs\n\n7.2\n \nVendors\n\n8\n \nGallery\n\n9\n \nReferences\n\n10\n \nNavigation\n\nHistory\n[\n]\n\nThe term \"Jirai Kei\" is derived from \"\nJirai Onna\n\" (地雷女), literally \"landmine woman,\" a derogatory term used to stereotype women, particularly those with mental illnesses such as Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), bipolar disorder, and other mood swing-inducing conditions, as a \"ticking time bomb.\" This term is often employed to dismiss women, frequently ex-girlfriends, as \"crazy\" or \"dangerous\" based on arbitrary traits, such as an affinity for kawaii aesthetics. Within the subculture, women are referred to as \"\nJirai Joshi\n\" (地雷女子), or \"landmine girls,\" while men are called \"\nJirai Danshi\n\" (地雷男子), or \"landmine boys.\"\n\nThe subculture became associated with various darker fashion styles following a \"psycho girlfriend\" dress-up challenge that gained viral traction during the March 2020 COVID-19 restrictions in Japan.\n[\n1\n]\n This challenge frequently referenced traits commonly associated with the Toyoko Kids, a group primarily composed of young runaway teenagers, some of whom were groomed online by older men with promises of a better life in the Kabukicho red-light district. These individuals are often exploited for sex work, drug trafficking, and other criminal activities.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\n\nWhile Western followers of Jirai Kei often attempt to separate it from its darker origins by viewing it solely as a fashion trend, the subculture largely retains a negative public image within Japan. Its associations with the \"psycho girlfriend\" trope are interpreted as a misogynistic stereotype, yet Japanese girls who identify as \"landmine\" fully embrace it.\n[\n4\n]\n This misunderstanding stems from several factors: the language barrier hindering accurate interpretation of Japanese articles and social media posts, a lack of awareness regarding the perception of mental health issues in Japan, and brands capitalizing on the subculture's popularity by using \"Jirai Kei\" as a marketing term, regardless of whether their products are genuinely associated with it.\n\nVisuals\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExample of a heavily edited selfie by @hiudayonn.\n \n \n\nGirls in this subculture add \nheavy filters and edits\n to their photos. Pale pink and white filters can add a slight haze to all of their images, and they are often decorated in \nvirtual stickers\n with Jirai Kei motifs. They also use \nface and body editing\n to the point of an unnatural appearance. Impossibly large eyes with anime proportions, making skin more pale, and making their bodies thinner and longer are extremely common in photos. This is with the goal of appearing eerie and puppy-eyed, diverging from the trend of \"pien\" makeup on Japanese tiktok. The color palettes of Jirai Kei is mainly white, black and pastel pink, though on occasion red, blue and grey is also used. \n\nTo contrast all of the sweet and girly visuals, violent imagery is often shown. \nBox-cutters, razors, and pockets knives\n are commonly featured in outfit posts. The stereotype is that a landmine girl would use it to threaten her boyfriend if he upsets her, or that she engages in self-harm. Additionally, these cute girls often pose with \nfake guns\n (firearms are illegal in Japan), cigarettes, or \nalcohol and energy drinks\n (from Strong Zero and Monster Energy) with straws, presumably to protect their lipstick while drinking. Many photos have color-scheme matching energy drink cans, and it is even popular to stack and glue the cans in the shape of machine guns. Similar to Yami Kawaii, there is often medical imagery of \npills and syringes\n, usually paired with narcotics and synthetic drugs. \n\nSanrio is strongly associated with the \nKawaii\n, girly, and consumer culture in Japan. As a result, girls into Jirai Kei are also associated with these characters, specifically \nKuromi\n and My Melody\n. People in this subculture own and take photos of plushies of these characters and own an assortment of merchandise, such as backpacks, pencil pouches, etc. themed around these characters. Sanrio has taken notice and even released Jirai Kei-inspired plushies of Kuromi and My Melody. Another character that can be associated is Menhera-chan, the suicidal magical girl that popularized \nYami Kawaii\n. Her artist has drawn her in stereotypical outfits, and her self-destructive habits could be relatable for those in the subculture. \n\nThere's also many artists engaging with the subculture who draw \nanime-style illustrations\n of landmine girls wearing the typical outfits while in stereotypical situations, such as taking selfies, holding a can while squatting on the streets, or having a mental breakdown. Jirai Kei followers often repost these \ndrawings on social media\n. \n\nFashion\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe various styles worn by jirai girls illustrated featuring Blue Archive characters. \n \n \n\nThe styles associated with Jirai Kei are constantly changing with the core defining trait being that the fashion is worn by landmine girls. Comparable to \nE-Girl\n’s style, while landmine girls may wear many different fashion styles, there is a main look typically associated with the aesthetic that evolved out of a mix of several different alternative genres. The initial look associated with the Jirai Kei subculture derived from \nJapanese Girly fashion\n and \nYami Kawaii\n, however outfits consisting out of \nGoth Punk\n, \nJersey Maid\n, and darker general \nalternative\n fashion have also been popular among its followers. As the trends within Jirai Kei keep on changing, many brands mimic one another and release mix-and-match variations for the various styles worn. The fabric of the clothes tends to be on the more synthetic side, with the quality not being that high, on account of them often being made by fast fashion companies who constantly adopt to the latest trends. \n\nRegardless of the style worn, the idea is to appear cute yet mature, but with an dark aura. \n\nThe ultra-feminine Jirai style has also evolved since its inception. As the style developed, the details of the style increased, with certain trends being more or less popular as certain garments from specific brands became viral. \n\nTops\n[\n]\n\nThe most common tops are \nblouses with ultra-feminine details\n that may slightly resemble \nLolita Fashion.\n Peter Pan and sailor collars, ruffles, lace trim, puffed sleeves, cold-shoulders, contrasting buttons are some tropes that are featured in the blouses. Alternative outfits use coat-dresses instead, and winter outfits utilize knit sweaters. Girls also often \ntie ribbons or add bow brooches with rhinestone or pearl-accented faux jewels\n at the neck. \n\nSome brands have also released \noversized tees and sweatshirts\n that can fit in with this aesthetic. They often have a print with a stereotypical motif, English text, anime prints, etc. These also contain feminine details, but less often. For example, there may be eyelets for lacing ribbon through, zippers, or detachable Peter Pan collars. This resembles the fashion of the \nYami Kawaii\n aesthetic, and contributes to an edgier and less girly look. Jirai boys add masculine or androgynous elements to this style, while girls like to pair these tops with chunky sneakers and necklaces. \n\nA trend that appeared approximately 2023 is the set-up, which is a two-piece set consisting of a \ntunic-length top with a matching pair of micro-shorts\n, with the aim of it looking like an extra-short dress, with the shorts being for modesty purposes. This top would have the same details as the blouses. \n\nBottoms\n[\n]\n\nHigh waisted mini skirts\n are by far the most popular bottom. The silhouette can be flared, trapezoid or pleated. \nSilver hardware details\n such as heart-shaped belt buckles, eyelets, and zippers add edge to the outfit and contrast the lace and girly details of the blouse. But there are also ruffles, ribbon lacing to resemble a corset, and ruffled suspenders to add girliness. \nShorts\n can also be featured in this aesthetic, as well as \nlonger flowy skirts\n. However, they are both comparatively rare to the mini skirts. Usually the bottoms are black while the top is pink or white, though sometimes this is flipped. \n\nThe more casual \nJersey Maid\n and \nYami Kawaii\n inspired looks can also have \ntrack pants\n like ones from Adidas as a pairing with a track suit jacket or oversized tee or sweatshirt. \n\nShoes and Legwear\n[\n]\n\nBecause the legs are most often exposed in this style, \nlace or fishnet stockings\n are worn, and could be switched or even doubled up with \nruffled or lace ankle socks\n. \n\nThe shoes are most commonly \nplatform loafers or multi-strapped mary janes\n, and most girls buy their shoes from BUBBLES Tokyo, DearMyLove, Liz Lisa and others. The shoes can be \nmore decorated,\n with faux jewels, ribbon laces, rhinestone buckles and silver cross charms. \n\nAccessories\n[\n]\n\nThe most popular bags are \ntotes and mini backpacks\n. Usually, they're pink or black, sometimes adorned with ribbons and bows with plushies or Sanrio figurine keychains attached. The most popular mini backpacks on social media are the studded MCM mini packpack and Melody Maison de Fleur totes. Other girls may instead use bags from \npopular luxury brands\n.\n\nAside from ribbons and bows, there is not much jewelry involved in Jirai Kei. Most styles include only earrings or neckwear like chokers, piercings and necklaces. A popular trend is the Viviene Westwood orb necklace. Because of the color scheme, many girls avoid gold jewelry and opt for silver.\n\nHair and Makeup\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAn illustration of the typical hairstyles by \nAkagumi-chan\n.\n \n \n\nHime-cut bangs,\n which are straight bangs across the forehead with side bangs around chin-length, are extremely popular amongst young women in Japan in general as it is an easy way to archive the illusion of a small face. It fits in with the ultra-feminine style. Because these women are Japanese and around high school age, the \nmost common hair color is black\n, since dyed hair is not allowed in schools. However, some girls add \nhighlights that can be bleached blonde or in different shades of pink.\n\nIn terms of styling, \npigtails\n (also called twin tails), are the majority hairstyle. They can be either low or high, with high pigtails often being \nhalf-up half-down\n. Girls often curl the ends and decorate these twin tails with \nribbons and bows\n, often with the same faux jewels on their brooches. Other \nhair accessories\n such as rectangle headdresses, headbands with faux jewels, and bobby pins with charms are popular too. \n\nFor the eye makeup, the most popular is an exaggerated version of the \"\nnamida bukuro\n\" makeup style where the \ntear bags\n are emphasized to look puffy as if the wearer is about to cry, which is further highlighted with pink undereye blush. The additional effect of appearing sickly is also desired. The \neyeliner is downturned to give a more \"puppy-like\"\n , feminine and sad appearance. \n\nFace and lip makeup are equally pink, with \nblush and sparkly highlighter being high\n on the cheekbones. \nLip makeup has a wide variation\n, with some looks being more matte, some glossy, some sculpted, some even. \n\nMany additional cosmetic products are also used for exaggerated features. \nFake lashes\n are generally popular in Japan, and in Jirai Kei, they are longer and spikier. \nDark circle lenses\n are also popular, and serve to make the eyes look bigger and anime-like. \n\nLong acrylic nails\n are also popular and often feature lace patterns, faux jewels, corset lacing, crosses, as well as stereotypical motifs like the pleading face emoji. \n\nMedia\n[\n]\n\nLiterature\n[\n]\n\nHost Madness\n - Oizumi Rika\n\nKabukicho Moratorium\n - Chiwawa Sasaki\n\nPeople Who Overdose\n - Chiwawa Sasaki\n\nThe Disease of Pien: Consumption and Approval of the SNS Generation\n - Chiwawa Sasaki\n\nManga\n[\n]\n\nAshita, Watashi wa Dareka no Kanojo - Tomorrow, I'll Be Someone's Girlfriend\n\nAndroid wa Jirai-kei no Yume wo Miru - Android Dreams of a Jirai Kei Girl\n\nKiken na Ren'ai - Dangerous Love\n\nKimi ni Aisarete Itakatta - It Hurts To Be Loved By You\n\nJirai Kareshi - My Boyfriend's a Ticking Time Bomb\n\nJirai-kei JK to Onee-chan no Hanashi - The Landmine Girl and Her Sister\n\nJirai Ninja Ruru no Shitsuren - Jirai Ninja Ruru's Heartbreak\n\nKakaKano - Dating the Kind of Girl You Shouldn't Get Involved With\n\nKoi wa Jirai wo Funde kara - A Love That Begins After Stepping On A Mine\n\nMitame Jirai-kei Osananajimi - My Childhood Friend Looks Like A Landmine But Isn't\n\nYamaarashi no Shisha (ヤマアラシのシーシャ)\n\nZenma (銭麻)\n\nTelevision\n[\n]\n\nAshita, Watashi wa Dareka no Kanojo\n\nCinderella Complex\n\nIshiko and Haneo: You're Suing Me?\n (episode 7)\n\nThe Black Swindler (episode 8)\n\nVideo Games\n[\n]\n\nJIRAIYA\n\nNeedy Streamer Overload\n\nSentimental Deathloop\n\nSuteki na Kanojo no Tsukurikata\n\nYandere ura Kano Jirai-chan\n\nYamikore\n\nLove Angel Syndrome\n\nMusic\n[\n]\n\nSongs\n[\n]\n\nAlice*Iris - Daikirai Lie Suki\n\nAlice*Iris - Gimme Me Love\n\nAmu - Pien Syndrome\n\nAmu - Mekka Warning\n\nCagayake - Unleash\n\nChilldspot - Ai Ai\n\nDECO*27 - The Vampire\n\nIsana - Menhera Janai Mon!\n\nHoneyWorks - Kawaikute Gomen\n\nKuraisekai - So Pien My Life\n\nKAFU - Egonomy\n\nKai - Unicorn Girl\n\nKai - Lose the Princess\n\nKairiki Bear - Darling Dance\n\nKareki Kashiwagi - Ikayaki-Wristed Girl\n\nLiLiPi - Shukipi Overdose\n\nMagnetite Hiiragi feat.

There are strong associations with mental illness, self harm, drug usage, sex work, underage prostitution, and other uncomfortable subjects. The negative aspects of the \"landmine\" stereotype are often emulated and romanticized as a quirky gimmick solely for aesthetic reasons.\n[\n5\n]\n On Twitter in particular, it's not uncommon for followers of the subculture to constantly promote self-destructive behaviour, the accounts often being part of \nshtwt\n (self-harm twitter) and \nedtwt\n (eating disorder twitter).\n[\n4\n]\n There's also a strong association with \"bangya\" culture with landmine girls also being stereotyped as groupies who are obsessive over their favorite bands and music artists to an unhealthy degree.\n\nAnother problem is the fetishization of the \"landmine\" stereotype, which is a glimpse into the wider topic of sexualizing women who exhibit mental illness. It is problematic for its ableist rhetoric claiming mentally-ill women to be \"freaky\", \"hot but crazy\" and more desirable sexually and emotionally, as well as its infantalistic undertone of these women being more emotionally attached and dependent on their lover's affection.\n[\n6\n]\n This fetishization of mentally ill women and use of the femme-fatale archetype ignores the unpleasant nuances of suffering from BPD or bipolar disorder and targets women who are mentally vulnerable to emotionally abusive, power-imbalanced relationships.\n[\n7\n]\n\nThere also have been issues caused by the strong associations with the host culture of Kabukicho. As people of any age can enter those establishments as long as no alcohol is served, male hosts have been actively going for young girls to spend money on them in exchange for affection, often resulting in the girls resorting to \"papa katsu\" (sugar-daddying) in order to afford their host club addiction.\n[\n8\n]\n\nBecause the clothes worn are often very brand specific, some Jirai Kei netizens suggest that there is slight elitism in the community for purchasing items from the \"correct\" stores, regardless of if the price can be prohibitively expensive, particularly for western followers that endure high shipping fees from Japanese brand proxies. On social media, especially on TikTok, some argue that this brand-focused side of Jirai Kei encourages hyper consumerism and trend-cycling while the same is also said for those who buy cheap replica items from problematic fast fashion stores like Shein/Romwe. \n\nAs the subculture can't be separated from its problematic parts precisely because they are what make Jirai Kei what it is, many have argued that its name shouldn't be used in a throwaway manner in reference to styles or trends in order to not expose strangers to potential triggering content. \n\nResources\n[\n]\n\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\nFor further reading, please read its \npage\n on the Jfashion Wiki. \n\nBlogs\n[\n]\n\nZirai Bijyo\n\nSubcul Zirai\n\nZirai Zyoshi\n\nVendors\n[\n]\n\nAnk Rouge\n\nAmilige\n\nBubbles\n\nDarrdy\n\nDearMyLove\n\nLafary\n\nLIZ LISA\n\nMA*RS\n\nNoemie\n\nReflem\n\nRojita\n\nSubcul Zirai\n\nTravas Tokyo\n\nViviene Westwood\n\nYosuke USA\n\nGallery\n[\n]\n\nキャンメイク縛り地雷メイク【イエベ・茶髪OK】\nA makeup tutorial\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n↑\n \nAbsolutely the largest eyes!!

As \"landmine\" is almost always used in negative context towards a person and to harass or demean, there has been controversy surrounding the name.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\n While the term has seen some use in Japanese media as a sales point, it is still seen as derogatory to the degree that the staff of various companies refuse to work on anything related to the term or trend.\n[\n6\n]\n\nWomen within the subculture are called \"Jirai Joshi\" (地雷女子), or landmine girls, while men in the subculture are referred to as \"Jirai Danshi\" (地雷男子), or landmine boys.\n\nOrigins and Controversy\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nDue to a makeup challenge by Japanese YouTuber SuReRo\n[\n7\n]\n that went viral during the March 2020 corona restrictions in Japan, which was about emulating the \"landmine woman\" stereotype, the term has been associated with various darker styles, gradually morphing into its own subculture.\n[\n8\n]\n\nJirai Kei has strong associations with some darker or disturbing themes, though not in the style on its own like \nYami Kawaii\n. In this case, Jirai Kei may be associated with self-harm, drug abuse, alcoholism, street partying, illegal sex work, and other rebellious and shocking behaviors. The associations of this kind of behavior with Jirai Kei is said to have its roots among the Toyoko Kids - a criminal gang mainly consisting out of teenage runaways that is active in Kabukicho, furthering its negative connotations.\n[\n9\n]\n Many criticize that Jirai Kei has contributed to harmful real life consequences, such as teens and young adults being groomed into self-destructive behavior in order to get accepted within the subculture.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\n\nThere's also arguments to be made for the supposed appropriation of the \"landmine\" stereotype by both Japanese and overseas followers of Jirai Kei as solely a fashion trend. Elements commonly associated with the stereotype are often emulated and romanticized as a quirky gimmick solely for aesthetic reasons.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n13\n]\n Meanwhile, those who engage in substance usage, self-harm, and sex work face criticism and demonization from others into Jirai Kei, especially overseas netizens, who wish to renounce them after accusations of Jirai Kei promoting problematic behavior by outsiders.\n[\n14\n]\n In response, some contend that Jirai Kei followers who engage in problematic behavior, labeled as \"lifestyle landmines\", are the true originators of the subculture and therefore should not be disowned from the community solely for the sake of maintaining the reputation of those who insist on only participating in the associated aesthetics of the subculture, labeled as \"fashion landmines\".\n\nDue to the controversies related to the Jirai Kei subculture, people both within Japan as well overseas have stated that it should be no longer promoted in reference to styles and trends as its the fashion part is already mostly encompassed in \nDark Girly\n and \nYami Kawaii.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n15\n]\n\nStyle Basics\n[\n]\n\nJirai Kei as a style has a strong focus on the overall styling rather than the clothes on their own, and therefore the fashions worn can vary to a high degree depending on the current common trends within the subculture.\n\nClothes\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStyles commonly worn by Jirai girls over the years.\n \n \nSince the initial boom in 2020, Jirai Kei has expanded into multiple directions and now covers a wide range of styles. The classic Jirai Kei outfit features \nGirly\n fashion and emphasizes a feminine yet mysterious aura with a focus on the color combination of black with muted pink, but occasionally also red or white.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n16\n]\n High collared blouses are being worn with a frilly high waist skirt and the clothes are often accented with lace and frills.\n[\n1\n]\n An alternative winter version of the style swaps the frilly blouse with a lacey sweater. Gemstone jewelry often includes rhinestones and pearls. Some of the most popular platform shoe choices are platform loafers and, more commonly, Mary Jane platform clogs (both are usually chosen from around 3 inches to 5 inches of back heel length). Lace trim socks or dark tights are be worn under the shoes.\n\nAs the initial look associated with Jirai Kei became mainstream, it started to move on to edgier alternative fashion looks.\n[\n3\n]\n The outfits of this type are generally unisex and often incorporate oversized \nYami Kawaii\n tops with their typical prints, the most popular being depictions of sick or injured stuffed animals, that are worn like a dress and reach a little below the thigh area. There's also many \nGoth Punk\n elements with ripped sweaters, bondage elements, fishnet tights, and massive platform shoes.\n[\n17\n]\n Tracksuits are also occasionally worn in combination with leg warmers or loose socks. Black is still in the central focus for the clothes but with vibrant colors such as red, blue, or purple, as accents. \n\nHair and Makeup\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nTypical \"namida bukuro\" makeup.\n \n \n\nJirai Kei makeup often resembles a highly exaggerated version of byojaku makeup with the typical pink or red under eye blush, emphasized tear bags, down-turned black eyeliner, and overall pale makeup foundation. Black circle lens contacts are commonly worn to make the eyes appear bigger, lipstick colors can vary based on how the wearer decides.\n[\n1\n]\n\nFor hairstyles, hime cut bangs, twin-tails with the ends curled (also referred to as pigtails), and black hair with highlights are most common, though many Japanese Jirai girls also dye strands of their hair to a darker pink color, or use colored extensions. Cute nail art (black and white being the most common colors) with gems and 3D art are also usually seen, especially incorporating Sanrio themes.\n\nAccessories\n[\n]\n\nCommon accessories in Jirai Kei include long black satin hair bows, Miu Miu bracelets, variants of the saturn logo necklace from Vivienne Westwood, a Jill Stuart handbag or MCM logo backpack in pale pink, as well as various types of Sanrio character accessories, most often featuring the characters My Melody or Kuromi.\n[\n1\n]\n Miss Dior perfume bottles are also vastly popular and a common perfume choice. Older adult women invested in the fashion sense can also seen drinking various types of alcohol, like \"Strong Zero\" with a straw, presumably to not disturb their makeup.\n[\n13\n]\n\nAttitude\n[\n]\n\nOn top of the style standing out, Jirai Kei also has a unique attitude of wanting to be in charge, or pushing to be seen and recognized. This slightly rebellious attitude is often seen in those who wear the style; underage high school girls can be seen smoking, drinking, and wandering city streets at night as part of this behavior. It also has ties to even darker themes, such as public promotion of self harm and underage prostitution (see the above \nControversy\n section).\n\nPopularity\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nManga cover featuring Yua Takahashi from \"Tomorrow, I'll Be Someone's Girlfriend\" (明日、私は誰かのカノジョ)\n \n \n\nDespite Jirai Kei being a younger and controversial subculture, it has seen some rise in popularity. Particularly, it has been covered by online magazines who reported about celebrities taking part in the initial makeup challenge, as well as featured by Japanese influencers and beauty gurus who created makeup tutorials for archiving the various looks.\n[\n8\n]\n During the height of its popularity, Jirai Kei's initial style has also been worn by the popular Japanese model Tsubasa Masuwaka, and she described it as \"cute with a gothic edge\".\n[\n18\n]\n\nAlthough it hasn't gained much media traction overseas, Jirai Kei has been mentioned a bit in various English media.\n[\n8\n]\n There also has been a slight increase of general awareness about the subculture due to the drama adaption of the manga \"Tomorrow, I Will Be Someone's Girlfriend\" with the character \"Yua\" representing both the stereotype as well as the style. Music featuring Jirai Kei characters has also become popular in the mainstream, with songs such as DECO*27's \"The Vampire\" featuring Hatsune Miku dressing and acting as a landmine girl reaching nearly 70M views as of late 2023.\n[\n19\n]\n\nBrands & Shops\n[\n]\n\nAnk Rouge\n\nAmilige\n\nBubbles\n\nDarrdy\n\nDearMyLove\n\nLafary\n\nLiz Lisa\n\nMA*RS\n\nNoemie\n\nReflem\n\nRojita\n\nSubcul Zirai\n\nTravas Tokyo\n\nViviene Westwood\n\nYosuke USA\n\nGallery\n[\n]\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n↑ \n1.0\n \n1.1\n \n1.2\n \n1.3\n \n\"Appearing all over Kabukicho!

Statements consisting only of original research should be removed.\n \n(\nJanuary 2025\n)\n (\nLearn how and when to remove this message\n)\n\nJapanese street fashion\n refers to a number of styles of contemporary modern clothing in \nJapan\n. Created from a mix of both local and foreign fashion brands, Japanese \nstreet fashions\n tend to have their own distinctive style, with some considered to be extreme and \nimaginative\n, with similarities to the \nhaute couture\n styles seen on European \ncatwalks\n.\n\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\n\nAs early as the 1950s, there were a few brands specially catered to street fashion, such as \nOnitsuka Tiger\n (now known as \nASICS\n).\n\nIn addition, the emergence of strong youth culture in the 1960s and 1970s that continues today (especially in \nHarajuku\n, a district in Shibuya, Tokyo) drives much of the development of new styles, looks, and fashion subcultures. The rise of \nconsumerism\n, which played an important part in Japan's \"national character\" during its economic boom in the 1980s, continues to influence fashion purchases, even after this economic bubble burst in the 1990s. These factors result in the swift turnover and variability in styles popular at any one time.\n[\n1\n]\n\nIn 2003, \nJapanese hip-hop\n, which had long been present among underground Tokyo's club scene, influenced the mainstream fashion industry.\n[\n2\n]\n The popularity of the music was so influential that Tokyo's youth imitated their favorite hip hop stars from the way they dress with oversized clothes to tanned skin.\n[\n3\n]\n\nThough extremely popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, many trends experienced a levelling off in the later 2000s and onwards; the rise and fall of many of these trends had been chronicled by \nShoichi Aoki\n since 1997 in the fashion magazine \nFruits\n, which was a notable magazine for the promotion of street fashion in Japan.\n[\n4\n]\n\nFashion industry and popular brands\n[\nedit\n]\n\nComme des Garçons garments on display at the \nMetropolitan Museum of Art\n\nAlthough Japanese street fashion is known for its mix-match of different styles and genres, and there is no single sought-after brand that can consistently appeal to all fashion groups, the huge demand created by the fashion-conscious population is fed and supported by Japan's vibrant fashion industry. \nIssey Miyake\n, \nYohji Yamamoto\n and \nComme des Garçons\n are often said to be the three cornerstone brands of Japanese fashion. Together they were particularly recognized as a Japanese fashion force in the early 1980s for their intensive use of \nmonochrome\n color and cutting-edge design.\n\nThe social motives driving interaction with and involvement in personal fashion choices and wider fashion movements within Japan are complex. Firstly, the comparatively large quantity of disposable income available to Japanese youth is significant; many argue this has been, historically, made possible through a greater degree of Japanese youth living at home with their parents for much longer than in other countries, reducing living expenses and thus making larger spending on clothing possible.\n[\n5\n]\n\nJapan is also known for its significant consumption of foreign luxury brands. According to data from 2006, Japan consumed 41 percent of the entire world's \nluxury goods\n.\n[\n6\n]\n The blue line of \nBurberry\n is among the most successful in this arena.\n\nJapanese street fashion influences the \nWest Coast of the United States\n.\n[\n7\n]\n High-end fashion brands like \nComme des Garçons\n have played a big role in the global industry since the 1980s, especially through frequent cross-over guest design with other brands. In 2008, \nRei Kawakubo\n designed for \nLouis Vuitton\n[\n8\n]\n and \nH&M\n.\n[\n9\n]\n Harajuku Fashion was ranked 5th in the fashion field of Google Search of the Year in 2019.\n[\n10\n]\n\nModern Japanese street fashion\n[\nedit\n]\n\nThough the styles have changed over the years, street fashion is still prominent in \nTokyo\n today. Young adults can often be found wearing subculture attire in large urban fashion districts such as \nHarajuku\n (\nUra-Harajuku\n), \nAoyama\n, \nGinza\n, \nOdaiba\n, \nShinjuku\n and \nShibuya\n.\n\nLolita\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nLolita fashion\n\nSweet Lolita (left) and Gothic Lolita (right)\n\nContaining many different themes within its boundaries, Lolita has become one of the larger, more recognizable styles in Japanese street fashion and has gained a following worldwide. Skirts or dresses are usually worn at or below knee length with petticoats beneath for volume. Blouses or tops are lace-trimmed or ruffled in the Victorian or Rococo style. The length of the socks or stockings can go from ankle to thigh level and may be topped with lace. Wearers of this fashion style often put on \nMary Janes\n, tea party shoes, or boots. The more well-known sub-styles within Lolita fashion are as follows:\n\nGothic Lolita - Lolita with a heavy influence from the Eastern and Victorian Goth style. Often characterized by dark colors and accessories adorned with motifs such as skeletons, bats, spiders, and other popular gothic 'icons', such as characters from \nTim Burton\n films. Victorian iron gates and architectural designs are also often seen in dress prints. Bonnets, rectangle headdresses, and brooches are popular accessories for Gothic Lolita.\n\nSweet Lolita - the most childlike style, mostly characterized by baby animals, fairy tale themes, and innocent, childlike attire. It was originally inspired by Victorian children's clothing and the \nkawaii\n culture that is very prevalent in Japan. Pastel colors are often used, although some dresses or skirts may feature darker or muted colors as well. Large head bows, cute purses, and stuffed animals are popular accessories for Sweet Lolita.\n\nClassic Lolita - a sub-style more closely resembling the historical fashion of the Rococo or Victorian eras. The colors that are used in this look are usually muted, thus giving this sub-style a more mature feel. Floral prints and solid colors are common, although fancier prints are not unheard of as well. Small head bows, bonnets, rectangle headdresses, and hair corsages are popular accessories for Classic Lolita.\n\nPunk Lolita - an experimental style, mixing the influences of Punk with Lolita. It can sometimes look deconstructed or crazy while keeping most of the 'Lolita silhouette'.\n\nOuji - also known as 'boy style', are the more masculine counterparts of lolita, influenced by Victorian boys' clothing. 'Prince pants', which are short capri-style pants that are cut off the knee, usually with some sort of detail (such as lace-edged cuffs) are commonly worn with masculine blouses, top hats, knee socks, and other accessories.\n[\n11\n]\n\nGyaru\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nGyaru\n\nGyaru\n being photographed in \nIkebukuro\n in 2009\n\nGyaru\n (sometimes known as \nGanguro\n, actually a subcategory of \ngyaru\n), is a type of Japanese street fashion that originated in the 1970s. \nGyaru\n focuses on girly-glam style, dwelling on man-made beauty, such as wigs, fake lashes, and fake nails. \nGyaru\n is also heavily inspired by Western fashion.\n\nGanguro\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nGanguro\n\nTwo \nganguro\n girls in Tokyo, April 2008\n\nThe \nGanguro\n style of Japanese street fashion became popular among Japanese girls in the early 1990s and peaked in the early 2000s. \nGanguro\n falls into the larger subculture of \ngyaru\n fashion. \nGanguro\n typically includes brightly colored outfits, mini-skirts, and tie-dyed \nsarongs\n. The \nganguro\n style consists of bleached hair, a deep tan, fake eyelashes, black and white eyeliner, bracelets, earrings, rings, necklaces, and platform shoes.\n\nMany people consider \nNamie Amuro\n to have been the leading figure of \nganguro\n style. Exactly after her public appearances with tanned skin and dyed hair, a lot of Japanese girls started to follow her example. The terms \n\"Yamanba\"\n and \n\"Manba\"\n refer to the extreme ends of the \nGanguro\n style. However, enthusiasts of both the \nYamanba\n and \nManba\n styles consider \nganguro\n as an \"easy version\" of their style. Nowadays, the name \n'Yamanba'\n has shortened to \n'Manba'\n. \n\n[\n12\n]\n\nKogal\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nKogal\n\nA \nkogal\n identified by her \nloose socks\n and shortened skirt\n\nThe \nKogal\n (\nKogyaru\n) look is based on a high school uniform, but with a shorter skirt, \nloose socks\n, and often dyed hair and scarf as well. Members of the \nKogal\n style sometimes refer to themselves as \nGyaru\n (gals). This style was prominent in the 1990s, and it started gaining popularity again at the end of 2020, however it is an age category specifically for gals in high school.\n\nBōsōzoku\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nBōsōzoku\n\nJapanese \ncosplayers\n dressed up in \nbōsōzoku\n-style outfits\n\nWhile \nbōsōzoku\n fashion has not been widely popular since the 1990s, the stereotypical \nBōsōzoku\n look is often portrayed, and even caricatured, in many forms of Japanese media such as anime, manga, and films. The typical \nbōsōzoku\n member is often depicted in a uniform consisting of a \njumpsuit\n like those worn by manual laborers or a \ntokko-fuku\n (\n特攻服\n)\n, a type of military issued over-coat with \nkanji\n slogans. These are usually worn open, with no shirt underneath, showing off bandaged torsos and matching baggy pants tucked inside tall boots.\n\nAmekaji\n[\nedit\n]\n\nAmekaji is a style based on American casual, often narrowly defined as Western/Native American/Biker-based. Amekaji was introduced to the public in the early 1990s by a group of delinquents in \nShibuya\n known as \"Teamer\". Later, it was popularized by \nTakuya Kimura\n who wore it in his TV dramas.\n\nDecora Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nExample of Decora fashion\n\nThe \nDecora Kei\n style originated in the late 1990s/early 2000s and rose to great popularity both in and outside Japan. It is exemplified by singer \nKyary Pamyu Pamyu\n, who rose to prominence in the \nHarajuku\n fashion scene before her musical debut. The wearers usually stick to a color scheme for their decora, such as Pink Decora, Red Decora, Dark Decora, and Rainbow Decora. A plain shirt and hoodie were often worn with short \ntutu\n-like skirts. The hair (often worn in low ponytails with long bangs) and make-up itself tend to be quite plain. However, the most significant part of \nDecora Kei\n is to pile on many layers of cute accessories until the bangs and front hair is barely visible. Stockings, legwarmers, arm warmers, and knee socks are also worn over each other in different layers. Common details also include \nleopard prints\n and patterned \ndental masks\n. The style has since decreased in popularity but still has a large following worldwide.\n\nVisual \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nVisual Kei\n\nVisual \nkei\n band \nVersailles\n\nVisual \nKei\n is a subculture created in the mid-1980s by Japanese musicians consisting of striking makeup, unusual hair styles, and flamboyant costumes, similar to Western \nglam rock\n and \nglam metal\n. \nAndrogyny\n is also a popular aspect of the style. Some of the more well-known and influential artists of the style include \nX Japan\n, \nLuna Sea\n, \nVersailles\n, \nThe Gazette\n, \nMejibray\n, \nRoyz\n, \nL'Arc-en-Ciel\n, \nAn Cafe\n, \nMalice Mizer\n, and \nDiaura\n.\n\nOshare Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nOshare Kei\n is the opposite side of Visual \nKei\n, with bright colors and many pop impressions. This said, bands under this style live up to the meaning by dressing up in colorful costumes, or in \nDecora\n or \nPop Kei\n style; many are seen sporting large amounts of jewelry and bags of anime characters and animals slung on, many colorful hairclips, and lighter make-up. The music is more happy sounding, the lyrics lighter and happier. Bands include \nAn Cafe\n, \nPanic Channel\n, Ichigo69, Lolita23q, \nSug\n, Delacroix, \nLM.C\n, and Aicle.\n[\n13\n]\n\nAngura Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nAngura Kei\n is a dark Japanese fashion that is often associated with a subgenre of \nVisual Kei\n. The term derives from the Japanese pronunciation of \"underground\", which refers to its origins in underground theater. The clothes tend to be heavily influenced by traditional Japanese elements as well as the \nShowa era\n (1926–1989) but with a Goth spin to it. The make-up usually consists of \nshironuri\n and is dark and heavy. While kimono is the most commonly used by visual \nkei\n artists, the style also often features modified Japanese school uniforms. Motifs and accessories are themed around post-war Japan and the occult.\n\nCult Party \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nCult Party \nKei\n, named after the Harajuku shop \nCult Party\n (now known as the \nVirgin Mary\n), is a style that was popular around the early 2010s and is based on Western religious artifacts like crosses or bibles. Common aspects include crosses wired in yarn, layers of fabric in soft colors, lots of cream lace and satin bows. The make-up and hairstyle is not as over the top as other styles. Cult Party \nKei\n is often worn with natural-looking make-up without any larger emphasis on the eyes and simple hair-dos with roses. Cult Party \nKei\n is considered by some to be a subset of Dolly \nKei\n.\n\nDolly \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nDolly \nKei\n is a style based on Japan's view of the \nMiddle Ages\n and European \nfairy tales\n, especially the \nBrothers Grimm\n and \nHans Christian Andersen\n. It includes a lot of vintage-style clothing and sometimes has religious symbols. \nGrimoire\n is a store in Japan that has been described as \"the pioneering store behind the Dolly-\nkei\n fashion scene\".\n[\n14\n]\n\nFairy \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nFairy \nKei\n is a youthful style based on 1980s fashion that evokes a dreamy, nostalgic feeling. Outfits are made up of pastel colors, angels, toys and generally cute motifs and elements and accessories from Western toy lines of the 1980s and early 1990s, such as \nPolly Pocket\n, \nMy Little Pony\n, \nStrawberry Shortcake\n, \nRainbow Brite\n, \nPopples\n, \nLady Lovely Locks\n, \nBarbie\n, \nWuzzles\n, and \nCare Bears\n. Pastel-colored hair is common, although natural hair is also popular, and hairstyles are usually kept simple and decorated with anything cute or pastel; bows are a common theme. Some common items used in a Fairy Kei coordinate include vintage sweaters, cardigans, varsity jackets, tutus, mini skirts, tights, over-the-knee socks, sneakers, and tea party shoes. The term \"Fairy \nKei\n\" originated from the magazine called \nZipper\n (despite a common belief that Sayuri Tabuchi [Tavuchi], the owner of Tokyo fashion store \nSpank!\n, was the accidental creator of the style).\n[\n15\n]\n\nGirly \nKei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nGirly \nKei\n is a hyperfeminine Japanese fashion style that emphasizes cute and girlish appearance. As opposed to the definition in English, Girly Kei does not generally only consider everything feminine and mature looks; Girly Kei tends to focus on lace, ribbons, ruffles, and patterns such as flowers and hearts, with soft and pastel colors such as pink being the main focus. There are many substyles and the popular image can vary depending on the current trends has pushed Girly Kei's evolution into a more hyper-feminine and innocent direction during the early 2020s because mainstream fashion trends took heavily from this style.\n\nMori Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMori Kei\n (\nmori\n meaning \"forest\") uses soft, loosely fitting layers of garments such as floaty dresses and cardigans. It places an emphasis on natural fabrics (\ncotton\n, \nlinen\n, \nwool\n) and hand-made or vintage accessories with a nature theme. The color scheme tends to be light and neutral, but patterns such as gingham and florals may also be used. In terms of hairstyles, bangs (often curled) and braids are very popular. The style is similar to Dolly \nKei\n in that the aim is to create a doll-like appearance but in a more casual, earthy manner.\n[\n16\n]\n\nJirai Kei\n[\nedit\n]\n\nA \nHatsune Miku\n cosplayer wearing Jirai Kei\n\nJirai Kei is the edgier counterpart to the aforementioned Girly Kei fashion style. Jirai Kei, literally meaning \"landmine type\", is a fashion subculture originating from Japan's \nKabukichō\n and spread in popularity in the early 2020s, which incorporates \ndark\n and \nkawaii\n styles. Described as similar to \nLolita\n and \nPreppy\n fashions in clothing, it's often paired with accessories with bow, heart, \ncross\n, and lace elements, and wear \nplatform shoes\n. The primary colors in Jirai Kei are black, white, and pale pink. It highlights femininity, cuteness, and fosters a sense of loveliness with the perfect balance of cool. The stereotype behind this subculture is that cute, hyper-feminine young women who dress in darker fashion styles have personalities that do not match their appearance. Rather than being sweet and kind, they are said to be violent and obsessive.\n[\n17\n]\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n\nGirly fashion has a wide range of different clothing types, like Girly Kei, Jirai Kei fashion has been met by widespread social prejudice, directed towards those who wear Jirai Kei and their lifestyle choices not just about being what western society thinks of as feminine. It highlights lace, ribbons, ruffles, and playful patterns like hearts, with soft pastel pinks as the main focus, perfectly balanced by striking blacks.\n[\n18\n]\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n\nPeeps\n[\nedit\n]\n\nPeeps is a 90s-inspired sporty goth style that has been popularized in Harajuku's underground scene by the online magazine \nPEEPS\n. It was voted one of the major trends for 2020 in the yearly trend forecast by the Japanese women's magazine \nMery\n.\n[\n19\n]\n\nKimono style\n[\nedit\n]\n\nDespite the widespread nature of Western clothing in Japan, Japanese fashion is still influenced by traditional clothing, with people still wearing the \nkimono\n in daily life, though most people wear it only for weddings, graduations, and other formal occasions.\n\nDespite the heavily reduced numbers of people wearing kimono as everyday clothing, the younger generation in Japan can still be seen to mix kimono and modern style in fashion, wearing modern footwear and accessories instead of the typical \ngeta\n and \nkanzashi\n usually worn. There are even modern designers who have used the kimono as inspiration, such as the \"TANZEN\" collection from designer Issey Miyake.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n\nGenderless\n[\nedit\n]\n\nMain article: \nGenderless fashion in Japan\n\nIn the mid-2010s, genderless fashion became widespread and focused on people wearing clothing that did not conform to their gender.

However, with changes in times and discourse environments, the meaning of the term has evolved based on social realities, developing different nuances. The term itself has also expanded its reach with the advancement of communication technologies, particularly forming a new youth subculture phenomenon in China. This article separately outlines the developmental history of \"Jirai Onna\" in both China and Japan, and provides a distinct summary of the developing history of \"Jirai Onna\" in both China and Japan. Finally, it provides a potential analysis of the factors that contribute to the disparities in the Landmine Girl culture that exist between China and Japan. The expectation is that this will be of use to researchers in the future who are investigating different young subculture organizations.\n\nKeywords: \n\nCultural Differences, Jirai Onna, Subculture\n\n Download PDF\n \n\n View PDF\n\nSun,R.

Social Networking Services (SNS), with their User-Generated Content (UGC) production model, have broken the monopoly of professionals over discourse power, promoting spontaneous communication among ordinary users and fostering a space for the flourishing of niche subcultures.\n\nAs East Asian countries, China and Japan share similar cultural foundations. The languages they use have commonalities in meaning, and their social atmospheres are also more alike. This provides a natural foundation for grassroots cultural exchanges. However, similar to other communication activities, subcultures inevitably present a more localized appearance in the final decoding stage of their dissemination process.\n\nThis paper selects the \"Jirai Kei\" (地雷系) culture originating from Japan, as an example, tracing its history and development in both China and Japan.\" It is more effective to discuss subcultures on the basis of discussing society. The analysis of fictional worlds is closely related to the understanding of the real world \"[1].\n\nMost previous research has focused on the dissemination process of subcultures or the psychological challenges faced by subcultural groups [2][3][4]. Few studies have conducted detailed comparisons of a specific subculture between two countries and explored the communication activities involved.\n\nThis paper aims to provide a reference case for future cross-cultural research and to enhance the objective understanding of the \"Jirai Kei\" culture group by the outside world.\n\n2.\n Main discussion \n\n2.1.\n The history of Jirai Kei culture in Japan \n\nThe origins of Jirai Kei culture can be traced back to the term \"Jirai Onna\" (地雷女), a popular internet catchphrase used around 2010 on the Japanese anonymous forum 2 channel (2ちゃんねる). This term was used to describe women who appeared cute on the surface but had serious issues in intimate relationships. Due to their seemingly harmless exterior hiding a potentially destructive nature—similar to a \"ticking time bomb\"—they were labeled as \"Jirai Onna\" or \"landmine women.\" When used to describe others, the term carries a derogatory connotation, often implying that the person suffers from mental illness. \n\nOther similar catchphrases include \"Pien-kei\" (ぴえん系) and \"Menhera\" (ﾒﾝﾍﾗ). \"Pien-kei\" is widely believed to have emerged around 2018 in the Kabukicho (歌舞伎町) area, named after the popular EMOJI \"Pleading Face\" (ぴえん) frequently used by Japanese youth. The rise of Pien-kei girls is closely tied to Kabukicho's host club industry. Sasaki Chiwawa [5] argues that \"Pien-kei girls essentially desire to be cute, but not everyone can achieve the 'mainstream' cuteness of actresses or models on TV. As a result, they gather in Kabukicho, where spending money can earn them compliments on their cuteness, and they fulfill their desires by spending on hosts.\" Through this behavior, which differs from traditional romantic relationships and is referred to as \"oshi\" (推し), they find meaning in their lives [6]. \n\nThe word \"Menhera\" emerged around the same time as \"Jirai Onna.\" It is a Japanese internet adaptation of the English term \"mental health\" and first appeared in the mental health section of 2channel. This term is most frequently used in Japanese research on Jirai Kei culture and is often associated with mental illnesses such as borderline personality disorder [7].\n\nGoogle search data also shows that \"Jirai Onna\" and \"Menhera\" had similar search frequencies during the same period, while the search curve for \"Pien-kei\" clearly reflects the characteristics of a new catchphrase emerging around 2020.\n\nFigure 1: Global search popularity of \"Jirai Onna\" (Blue Line), \"Menhera\" (Green Line), and \"Pien-kei\" (Red Line) from January 2004 to February 13, 2025\n\nAlthough the three catchphrases—\"Jirai Onna,\" \"Menhera,\" and \"Pien-kei\"—differ in their etymology, origins, and time of emergence, they share similar meanings. All are used to describe individuals (primarily women) who appear delicate and pitiable on the surface but are emotionally unstable or mentally troubled. We collectively refer to these three catchphrases as \"Jirai Kei\" in the following sections.\n\n2.2.\n The current state of Jirai Kei in Japan \n\n2.2.1.\n Jirai Kei as a standalone fashion culture \n\nIn contemporary Japan, Jirai Kei has evolved beyond its original catchphrase to become a distinct fashion subculture. This transformation reflects the complex interplay between online identity and real-world expression of young people.\n\nJirai Kei is characterized by its mix of cuteness and darkness, often incorporating elements such as pastel colors, frilly dresses, and childlike accessories alongside darker motifs like crosses, bandages, and gothic-inspired details. This aesthetic serves as a visual metaphor for the inner turmoil and emotional instability associated with the Jirai Kei identity. \n\nThe rise of Jirai Kei as a fashion trend can be attributed to its resonance with individuals who feel marginalized or misunderstood by mainstream society. By adopting this style, they express their struggles with mental health, relationships, and societal pressures in a way that is both personal and communal. Social media platforms, particularly Instagram and Twitter, have played a significant role in popularizing Jirai Kei fashion, allowing individuals to share their outfits, connect with like-minded people, and build a sense of belonging. Jirai Kei as a youth subculture reflect the values of youths today and resist elements of society in a visually stimulating way [8].\n\nHowever, the commercialization of Jirai Kei fashion had sparked debates. Some critics argue that the subculture's origins in mental health struggles and emotional vulnerability are being diluted as it becomes more mainstream.\n\n2.2.2.\n To-yoko kids(ﾄｰ横ｷｯｽﾞ) with Jirai Kei\n\nNext to the Toho Building in Kabukicho, there are often many young people gathered alone, wandering outside. Most of them are between 12 and 19 years old, having chosen to run away from home due to conflicts with their parents. Their numbers are so large that it has become a social phenomenon, and they are referred to by a specific term: \"To-yoko kids\" (ﾄｰ横ｷｯｽﾞ). \n\nMany of these To-yoko kids are minors who have not completed their education and lack the skills to make a living, making it difficult for them to participate in regular work. To cover daily expenses, many young women turn to \"sugar dating\" (ﾊﾟﾊﾟ活 ) relationships to earn money. Some girls choose to wear \"Jirai Kei\" fashion. This cute style not only enhances their physical attractiveness but also helps them quickly become the part of To-yoko kids community.\n\nMany people living here have no time to plan for the future, and they can only drift through the red-light district. The culture of the red-light district subtly influences their habits. Many To-yoko kids have unhealthy practices such as drug overdose, self-harm, and prostitution [9]. These behaviors serve as desperate ways for them to cope with the harsh realities they face.\n\nIt can be said that the To-yoko kids are the group that most closely aligns with the original definition of \"Jirai Onna\" today, and their expressions of it have become even more extreme. This phenomenon reflects structural deficiencies in Japanese society regarding youth protection and educational support.\n\n2.3.\n The development of Jirai Kei culture in China \n\nThe introduction of \"Jirai Kei\" to China occurred later than its emergence in Japan. Initially, it spread through anime and music, becoming integrated with otaku culture. In the early Chinese internet context, \"Jirai Kei\" did not carry a negative connotation but was instead seen as a \"cute\" associated with anime characters. The dangerous and emotionally unstable aspects of \"Jirai Onna\" were downplayed, transforming the image into one of a cute, well-dressed girl.\n\n A cute example is \"Menherachan\", a character who gained popularity on Bilibili in 2018. Another example closer to the original meaning of \"Jirai Onna\" is the VOCALOID song \"Venom\" (ﾍﾞﾉﾑ), released the same year. These two distinct perceptions of Jirai Kei culture became recognized as part of “otaku culture” in China, though they had not yet fully entered the mainstream internet lexicon. \n\nThe turning point for the development of \"Jirai Kei\" in China came after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019. Compared to the past, the pandemic lockdowns brought greater mental stress, forcing the younger generation to spend more time online.\n\nIn 2022, the release of the game “NEEDY GIRL OVERDOSE” further propelled the spread of the \"Jirai Onna\" label in China, as the game's protagonist embodied the typical appearance and mental state of a \"Jirai Onna.\" To cope with the pressures of daily life and seek emotional satisfaction and freedom, netizens began to freely create symbols and mock any form of rigidity [10][11]. Despite knowing that \"Jirai Onna\" originally carried a derogatory meaning, many people adopted self-deprecating humor to embrace and role-play as \"Jirai Onna,\" using it as a way to accept their unchangeable reality and gain a sense of belonging online [12], forming new interest-based communities. In China, these communities are primarily rooted in social platforms with a majority female user base, such as Redbook and Weibo. \n\n2.4.\n Similarities and differences between Chinese and Japanese Jirai Kei culture \n\nJapan's \"Jirai Kei\" culture started as a way to categorize real-life individuals or groups, reflecting societal realities. Essentially, it evolved from offline to online but never fully detached from its red-light district roots. This connection means the culture not only emerged from the red-light district but also draws those who identify as \"Jirai Onna\" or \"Jirai Otoko\" back into that environment.\n\nIn China, \"Jirai Kei\" culture began online and has since taken root in major social media platforms, forming virtual communities without physical gathering spaces. Unlike in Japan, Chinese enthusiasts focus less on internal struggles and more on their social media appearance, striving to match the standard Japanese \"Jirai Onna\" aesthetic. In anonymous forums, criticism often targets photos for having a \"China style\" (中味), citing issues like body shape, light makeup, or skin tone that deviate from the traditional \"Jirai Onna\" look. A brand hierarchy has also emerged, with Japanese labels favored over local ones, despite their higher cost.\n\nWhile Japanese \"Jirai Onna\" culture initially aimed to attract male attention and build relationships, its Chinese counterpart has blended with radical feminist ideas. Many Chinese \"Jirai Onna\" reject men entirely, criticizing them solely for their gender, even if they show interest in the culture. As a result, men are often excluded from participating or speaking in these communities.\n\n3.\n Conclusion\n\nDespite the many differences between Chinese and Japanese Jirai Kei cultures, there is one key similarity: just as Jirai Kei culture is gaining popularity in China, its prominence in Japan has also been rising in recent years. The resurgence of Jirai Kei culture symbolizes a shared societal pressure in both countries—unhappy family environments and overly competitive, \"involutionary\" social systems have forced young people, who feel unable to participate in this competition, to choose a path of rebellion. Through social media, ordinary people are exposed to a broader world and more possibilities, but the stark contrast between the idealized hologram of happiness online and the harsh realities of life creates a sense of helpless disconnection. Identifying with pre-modern subcultures may be a way to seek security and escape reality.\n\nWe need more unbiased understanding to clarify the root causes of these phenomena. It is hoped that future research will provide opportunities to delve deeper into the lives of Jirai Kei communities in both China and Japan, exploring how cultural dissemination operates and how geographical, economic, and political factors have shaped the same external culture into different core identities.\n\nReferences\n\n[1].

What does \"Seiso-kei Joshi\" mean? A guide to \"○○-kei Joshi/Danshi (girl/guy)\" based on personality and fashion\n\nUpdated on\n Aug 21, 2025\n\nPublished on\n Mar 22, 2025\n\nAuthor\n\n Yukari\n \n\nEditor\n\n Cody Ng\n \n\n # Japanese Culture\n \n\n # Fashion\n \n\n LIKE\n \n\nHave you ever heard terms like \"Himono Onna\" or \"Fujoshi\" in Japanese dramas and anime? These phrases have evolved, and in recent years, more variations of \"○○-kei Joshi\" and \"○○-kei Danshi\" have emerged, such as \"Jirai-kei Joshi,\" \"Minato-ku Joshi,\" and \"Nikushoku-kei Danshi.\" In this article, we will introduce some of the most commonly used \"○○-kei Joshi/Danshi\" in Japan, explaining their meanings and characteristics in terms of personality and \nfashion\n. Which type do you belong to?\nPersonality Type ①: What is \"Jirai-kei Joshi\"? What is \"Intelli-kei Danshi\"?\n地雷系女子 (Emotionally volatile girl) / ぴえん系女子 (Cutesy and clingy girl)\n\n \n\"Jirai-kei Joshi\" is characterized by dark-colored outfits and bold makeup. Their emotions tend to be unstable, with dramatic mood swings, which is why they are called \"Jirai-kei\" (\"landmine-type\"), reflecting their explosive emotional tendencies. They are highly sensitive and easily hurt, but they also have deep affection. Once they open their hearts to someone, they become deeply devoted.\n \nサバサバ系女子 (Cool and independent girl)\n\n \n\"Saba-saba-kei Joshi\" refers to women who have a straightforward and carefree personality, showing little interest in others in a good way. They dislike flattery, speak their minds openly, and have an independent mindset. However, there is also a type often ridiculed as a \"self-proclaimed Saba-saba-kei Joshi.\" These individuals tend to have a strong need for validation, often talking about themselves excessively.\n \n理系男子 (Science guy)\n\n \n\"Rikei Danshi\" refers to men who studied science and engineering subjects in school or have a logical, analytical way of thinking. They excel at approaching things rationally and tend to be calm and composed, with little emotional fluctuation. Since scientific fields require perseverance and precision, many of them are also diligent and detail-oriented. On the other hand, their deep focus on tasks can lead them to prioritize work over relationships, sometimes isolating themselves in their own world.\n \nインテリ系男子 (Intellectual guy)\n\n \n\"Intelli-kei Danshi\" are men with extensive knowledge and education, exuding an intellectual and refined aura. They are known for their composed speech and sophisticated demeanor and enjoy engaging in intellectual and logical discussions. However, the term can also be used mockingly to describe men who boast about their intelligence and knowledge.\n \nこじらせ男子 (Socially awkward guy)\n\n \n\"Kojirase-kei Danshi\" refers to men who have unique obsessions or biases about romance and relationships, often overthinking things in a negative way. Their personalities can be extreme, either having a high sense of pride or an exceptionally low self-esteem, making it difficult for them to develop romantic relationships. Despite this, they often have a sensitive and easily hurt inner side.\n \nPersonality Type ②: Food-based Personality Types – \"Nikushoku-kei,\" \"Soushoku-kei,\" and more\n肉食系女子・肉食系男子 (Go-getter in relationships)\n\n \nThis term describes people who take an assertive approach in romance and relationships. \"Nikushoku-kei Joshi\" are confident and proactive in love, often making the first move. They are comfortable with physical touch, openly expressing affection, and are not afraid to confess their feelings. \"Nikushoku-kei Danshi\" have a masculine, ambitious, and positive personality. They actively ask for contact information, invite people out for meals, and take the lead in dating situations.\n草食系女子・草食系男子 (Passive in dating)\n\n \nIn contrast to \"Nikushoku-kei (Go-getter in relationships),\" these individuals are passive or reserved when it comes to romance. \"Soushoku-kei Joshi\" are quiet, gentle, and shy, often taking a passive role in relationships. Similarly, \"Soushoku-kei Danshi\" do not actively pursue romantic interests and are usually not overly focused on love. They tend to prioritize their hobbies and personal interests over dating, valuing their own time above all.\n \nロールキャベツ系女子・ロールキャベツ系男子 (Looks shy but actually bold in love)\n\n \nA middle ground between \"Nikushoku-kei (Go-getter in relationships)\" and \"Soushoku-kei (Passive in dating).\" These individuals may appear passive at first but are actually quite assertive in relationships. \"Roll Cabbage-kei Joshi\" seem demure on the outside but are bold and proactive in love, unafraid to make their feelings known. \"Roll Cabbage-kei Danshi\" often have a refreshing and mild outward appearance, but when alone with someone they like, they show a more masculine and assertive side, actively pursuing the person they are interested in.\n \n絶食系女子・絶食系男子 (Romantically detached)\n\n \nUnlike \"Nikushoku-kei\" or \"Soushoku-kei,\" these individuals have no interest in romance at all. \"Zesshoku-kei Joshi\" do not dislike men or struggle with relationships; they simply prefer to focus on themselves and their personal lives rather than dating. \"Zesshoku-kei Danshi\" have the same mindset—they see romance as unnecessary and prioritize other aspects of life. However, both tend to have many friends and are often good at socializing.\n \nPersonality Type ③: Animal-based Personalities – \"Puppy-like,\" \"Cat-like,\" and More\n犬系女子・犬系男子 (Puppy-like personality)\n\n \nPeople with a \"puppy-like personality\" are affectionate and expressive, much like dogs. \"Puppy-kei Joshi\" are bright, cheerful, and incapable of telling lies, embodying a pure-hearted nature. However, they can also be clingy and skilled at seeking attention when they feel lonely. Similarly, \"Puppy-kei Danshi\" have an innocent and friendly disposition, often radiating warmth with their smiles. In relationships, they are devoted to their loved ones, remaining loyal and affectionate, just like a dog that follows its owner faithfully.\n \n猫系女子・猫系男子 (Cat-like personality)\n\n \nA \"cat-like personality\" refers to people who are independent and dislike being tied down, much like cats. \"Cat-kei Joshi\" are known for their \"tsundere\" nature, switching between being aloof and affectionate. They value freedom but will approach others when they want attention or affection. \"Cat-kei Danshi\" dislike rigid rules and prefer acting on their own terms rather than following group norms. Since they cherish their personal space, they tend to prioritize alone time.\n \nウサギ系女子・ウサギ系男子 (Bunny-like personality)\n\n \nPeople with a \"bunny-like personality\" are sensitive to loneliness and crave attention, much like rabbits. \"Bunny-kei Joshi\" are particularly sensitive to being alone and excel at showing their affectionate side. \"Bunny-kei Danshi\" have a gentle and endearing presence, often taking great care of their appearance, which gives them a clean and well-groomed look. Though initially shy, once they open up to someone, they become affectionate and may even show a slightly spoiled side.\n \nキツネ系女子・キツネ系男子 (Fox-like personality)\n\n \nIn Japan, foxes are often seen as cunning and elusive creatures, so a \"fox-like personality\" describes someone mysterious and hard to read. \"Fox-kei Joshi\" are thoughtful and observant, making them excellent at reading the room and anticipating others' needs, often being perceived as perceptive and considerate. \"Fox-kei Danshi\" are serious and cautious, preferring stability over major changes. Like their female counterparts, they are skilled at understanding social dynamics, making them good at interpersonal relationships.\n \nタヌキ系女子 (Raccoon-like personality)\n\n \n\"Tanuki-kei Joshi\" have a warm and approachable aura, creating a relaxing atmosphere for those around them. A defining feature is their round and soft facial features, often with large, expressive eyes. Their gentle and easygoing nature makes them naturally sociable and considerate, making them well-loved by both men and women.\n \nゴリラ系男子 (Strong and tough guy)\n\n \nDue to their strong and powerful image, \"Gorilla-kei Danshi\" are known for their physical and mental toughness. They are often found in athletic or sports-oriented circles, characterized by their disciplined and hardworking nature. They are serious, well-mannered, and push themselves to the limit. While they hold themselves to high standards, they also have a kind heart and a surprisingly sensitive side.\n \nAppearance and \nfashion\n: Neat girls, street boys, etc.\n清楚系女子 (Elegant and modest girl)\n\n \nPeople with a \"Seiso-kei\" style are known for their simple and refined appearance. They prefer modest outfits in white, pastel, or other soft tones, avoiding excessive exposure. Their makeup is natural, and their hair is often long, dark, and glossy. Their personality tends to be calm and polite, leaving an impression of femininity and elegance.\n \n量産型女子 (Cookie-cutter girl)\n\n \n\"Ryosan-gata Joshi\" refers to women who embrace the latest trends in \nfashion \nand makeup, often following popular styles. Because they adopt widely trending looks, their appearance tends to resemble others with similar \nfashion \nchoices, leading to the term \"mass-produced\" (Ryosan-gata).\n \n美魔女 (Timelessly beautiful woman)\n\n \nA term coined by \nfashion \nmedia, \"Bimajo\" refers to women aged 35 and older who maintain a youthful glow. They not only focus on their external beauty but also cultivate inner elegance through their life experiences.\n \n森ガール (Forest girl) \n\n \n\"Mori Girl\" describes women who wear loose, natural clothing that hides their body lines, resembling an ethereal presence in a forest. This style peaked around 2009.\n \n塩顔男子 (Delicate and cool-looking guy)\n\n \nMen with a \"shio-gao\" face have thin eyes, pale lips, and delicate nose lines, giving them a refreshing and clean look. They often have an androgynous aura, a slim physique, and prefer hairstyles like a tousled natural look or a mushroom cut.\n \n爬虫類系男子 (Reptile-like guy)\n\n \nMen with a \"hachu-rui gao\" (reptilian face) have wide-set eyes, a well-defined nose bridge, and a sharp, triangular face shape. Their skin is usually fair and translucent, with prominent lips. These unique features give them an enigmatic and mysterious charm.\n \nメガネ女子・メガネ男子 (Glasses-wearing girl/guy)\n\n \nMen and women who wear glasses are often perceived as intelligent and serious. The type of frames can greatly influence their impression, and many wear \"fake glasses\" as a \nfashion \nstatement.\n \nストリート系女子・ストリート系男子 (Street-style girl/guy)\n\n \nPeople who favor street \nfashion\n, including sneakers, caps, and hoodies, inspired by hip-hop and skater culture.

{"url": "https://rentablog.org/2023/09/19/japanese-for-nerds-oshikatsu-otakatsu-blkatsu-and-language/", "title": "Japanese for NERDS: Oshikatsu, Otakatsu, BLkatsu, and language – rentaBLog", "text": "Japanese for NERDS: Oshikatsu, Otakatsu, BLkatsu, and language – rentaBLog\n\nSkip to content\n\nAs you may have seen from my posts, I like to sprinkle in a lot of Japanese to help people learn and contextualize the language and culture a majority of our content comes from. While we’re a localization company, I know a lot of people who read manga do intend on eventually learning and hopefully mastering Japanese someday, whether it’s in order to not have to rely on English licenses to get that sweet, sweet content, or even just to be able to comfortably follow Japanese mangaka, publishers, or fan accounts, and it can be helpful to learn bit by bit through your hobbies.\n\nStill in the process of my own Japanese-learning journey (I think most language learning never actually ends, honestly—even in your native language), after living in Japan for four and a half years I’ve found there are a lot of words that’re hard to know without specifically taking part in the cultures surrounding them. The same way, say, Dungeons & Dragons or Genshin or even sports fanbases have their own own vocabulary and phrases that don’t make a lot of sense outside their core community, being a nerd in Japan has its own language that can be a bit difficult to grasp for those not in the know.\n\nA lot of these words take place within 推し活 (\noshikatsu\n, a word that’s hard to translate but is essentially “oshi life”)—the words people use to talk about their favorite characters, idols, artists, etc. The word \noshikatsu\n is a portmanteau (the Japanese language \nloves\n a good portmanteau) of 推し (\noshi,\n or fav, bias, etc.) and 活動 (\nkatsudou\n, activities), so essentially the activities and lifestyle of having an \noshi\n. People who already take part in online or in-person Japanese otaku events likely already know this world well—the world otaku allow themselves to fall into once they’ve finished the dull slog of everyday life. The real world might suck, but at least we have \noshikatsu\n to unwind to and enjoy with friends.\n\nIt’s actually such a common word at this point that it’s not rare to walk in to very average or trendy stores and see an \noshikatsu\n section filled with colorful \nnui\n clothes, things to make \nuchiwa\n, or even just pouches and accessories in colors that are common signifiers of your fav idol or character. (For instance, my favorite character from Genshin is Xiao, so I tend to buy a lot of thing in the teals, greens, and soft purples that make up his color palette.) Trendy bakeries, cake shops, etc.—living an otaku lifestyle is very common and normal, and it’s not rare at all seeing stores and brands catering to it.\n\nNonetheless, there are still a lot of words that are so highly specific to actually living \noshikatsu\n, \notakatsu\n (“otaku life”), or \nBLkatsu\n (“BL life”) so I’ll introduce some of those words here. (Using Genshin characters and ships for many of my examples, since those are the names I know best lol.)\n\n====================\n\n推し（おし） \noshi\nLet’s start with the easiest and most well-known phrases, but arguably the most important. \nOsu\n sounds similar to “push” but the kanji is different (押す) so the meaning also differs. This version is specific to the act of supporting, backing, or endorsing something. \nOshi\n is the noun version. It can be used like “Xiao is my \noshi\n!” but also “I am Xiao-\noshi\n!”\n\n単推し（たんおし）\ntan’oshi\nTan’oshi\n (not to be mistaken for 楽しい/\ntanoshii\n) isn’t super different from \noshi\n, but it’s a specific word used for when you like a group, but there is one member of the group you \nspecifically\n really really really love—your fav \nwithin\n a group that you like.\n\n箱推し（はこおし）\nhako’oshi\nHako’oshi\n is kind of the opposite of \ntan’oshi\n. \nHako\n means “box” so essentially you like a group as a full package and don’t particularly have a specific favorite member—you love everyone equally! \n\n====================\n\nオタク　\notaku\nEveryone knows this. Even non-otaku know this. But I wanted to include it to point out it’s actually a very common word, and doesn’t have the negative connotation that’s often pushed in the West. Anyone can be an otaku—it just means having an intense interest in something, from trains to idols to fashion to animals.\n\n腐女子（ふじょし）\nfujoshi\n“Ames, do you really think we don’t know what \nfujoshi\n means?” I’m sure everyone who reads this already knows this word, but it also felt wrong to leave it out of this section. For those who don’t know, \nfujoshi\n is an otaku who is specifically interested in BL content, whether in an “original content” sense or a “shipping” sense. \nFujoshi\n does NOT just mean a female otaku; some have tried to claim it as such but always get shot down by the larger community. (See also: 腐男子/\nfudanshi\n which is the male version, and \nfujin\n, the gender-neutral term which is exclusive to western spaces.)\n\n姫女子（ひめじょし）\nhimejoshi\nA \nhimejoshi\n is a female fan of GL/yuri! These are people who enjoy GL ships as well as original manga. There are some fans who exclusively prefer GL, but some might like BL and GL equally!\n\n夢女子（ゆめじょし）\nyumejoshi\nAs many know, \nyume\n means “dream.” A \nyumejoshi\n is a girl who prefers to self-insert with the male characters she likes. When she refers to her \noshi\n as her husband, she’s not being ironic or silly. There is sometimes \nsome\n polite crossover between \nfujoshi\n and \nyumejoshi\n but it’s generally not common, since they’re antithetical to each other.\n\nガチ恋（ガチこい）\ngachikoi\nGachikoi\n, or “legit love,” is used to refer to the act of falling in literal, sincere love with your \noshi\n. This is a bit more common in 2.5D and 3D fandoms, but is also possible with 2D. This term is often used disparagingly, since \ngachikoi\n are frequently seen as quite toxic and possessive of their \noshi\n, but it is possible to be a \ngachikoi\n without being weird about it.\n\n====================\n\nボーイズラブ・BL\nIf you don’t know what this is, I’m shocked you somehow made it to this blog. Boys’ Love is the genre name for depictions of male/male romantic and sexual relationships. I’m assuming you’re a fan of this if you’re reading this post. \n\nガールズラブ・GL\nGirls’ Love, perhaps more commonly referred to as yuri, is simply the female version of BL. There doesn’t seem to be much differentiation between yuri and GL the way there is for yaoi and BL, as most Japanese stores use the two names interchangably. \n\nティーンズラブ・TL\nTL is what we refer to on Renta! as “mature romance,” but the actual phrase is “teens love.” In all honesty, I’m not sure why it’s referred to as such, but the name had to be changed for a western market since this is all erotic content aimed at adult women, not teens. \n\nNL・HL\nNL and HL are the words used for het relationships and content. HL obviously stands for “hetero love.” Unfortunately NL stands for “normal love,” but I’ve been told there’s been a move away from this in recent years specifically because it’s rather offensive.\n\n====================\n\n一次創作（いちじそうさく）\nichijisousaku\nIchijisousaku\n can also just be referred to as \nsousaku\n, which is original content. This is not fanart or anything based off an existing series or franchise. The reason \nichi\n is sometimes placed at the front is in case an artist posts both original and derivative works to their account; by tagging it as \nichijisousaku\n it’s easy to differentiate that it’s their original work.\n\n二次創作（にじそうさく）\nnijisousaku\nNijisousaku\n, however, IS content based off an existing series, title, or franchise. This is all fanart, fanfiction, \ndoujinshi\n, and even cosplay content. Sometimes a mangaka will have a \nnijisousaku\n account specifically where they post fanart and such, but sometimes they leave it all in one place.\n\n創作BL（そうさくBL）\nsousaku BL\nAs you may have guessed by now, \nsousaku BL\n refers to original BL, so anything tagged with this uses original characters specific to the artist. This can be both self-published \nor\n commercial content.\n\n商業BL（しょうぎょうBL）\nshougyou BL\nShougyou BL\n, however, refers very specifically to licensed, published, commercial BL works. This means the title is commercially released in stores, and it’s not self-published by the author, or just a short story they wrote for social media. This is a useful tag for tracking down new titles and releases to look out for.\n\n====================\n\n沼（ぬま）\nnuma\nNuma\n means “swamp” or “bog.” Have you ever stepped into a swampy marsh and felt it pulling you down? And then it’s hard to pull your foot back out because of the pressure and suction from the mud? That’s \nnuma\n—a semi-joking phrase that means you’ve been dragged down into the filth of a series or character or pairing and now there’s no getting out. This is particularly common when someone is feeling themselves dragged into a new fandom, or trying to convince a friend to get in the “swamp” with them.\n\n====================\n\nジャンル　\ngenre\nDO NOT be fooled by this phrase—it sits firmly in the camp of \nwasei eigo\n, Japanese phrases taken from English that mean something only vaguely related. “Genre” in the \noshikatsu\n sense refers to the series or fandom, \nnot\n the content within (romance, action, scifi, and so on).\n\nI made this mistake once with a Japanese friend who planned on tabling at a \ndoujinshi\n event. She told me she was planning to release a Touken Ranbu book, and I asked “which genre?” and she gave me a weird look and repeated “Touken Ranbu.” Needless to say, I’ll never forget the difference now.\n\n====================\n\n次元（じげん）シリーズ　\n“jigen” series\nJigen\n means “dimension” so these are used to differentiate between fiction and reality…\n2次元（にじげん）\nni jigen\nNijigen\n is the 2D world, where fictional oshi roam. Anime, game, and manga otaku are the lords of the \nnijigen\n, and many of these type of otaku say they’re really only interested in 2D.\n\n3次元（さんじげん）\nsan jigen\nSanjigen\n is often used as slang to refer to the “real world,” the one where humans roam. 2D otaku may often speak disparagingly of “3D” and the things within (similar to phrases like “I’m not interested in 3D men—only 2D!”), but there are also many otaku who like 3D things like idols, musicians, movie stars, etc. A BL mangaka oshi would also be included in here (though it feels weird to phrase it that way).\n\n2.5次元（にてんごじげん）\nni-ten-go jigen\nNi-ten-go\n is the weird space between filled by actors \nplaying\n your fictional oshi, common to stage plays or occasionally drama or movie roles. However, 2.5 can also be used to refer to \nseiyuu\n or VTubers—people who you may like only because they voice your fictional fav, or you know there’s a real human in there somewhere, but you like them based on their fictional, 2D persona. \n\n生もの（ナマモノ）\nnamamono/\nnmmn\nAs was previously discussed in the post all about \nnamamono\n rules and culture, this is the shipping of actual living, breathing, 3D (or 2.5D) humans. \nNama\n means “raw” and \nmono\n means “thing” or “object,” so \nnamamono\n content is content dealing with living organisms. If you want to read more about \nnamamono\n, check out: \n“There’s Fanfiction About Us?”\n\n====================\n\nカップリング　\ncoupling\n“Coupling” (“CP”) or \nkappu\n is just the word for “ship.” \n\n推しカップ（おしカップ）\noshikappu\n / 自カップ（じカップ）\njikappu\nOshikappu\n or \njikappu\n refers to “OTP”—this couple is your ride or die, the one you put all of your time and effort head-canoning and creating content for. \n\n====================\n\n右・左（みぎ・ひだり）\nmigi/hidari\nAs many people who’ve taken beginner Japanese know, \nmigi\n and \nhidari\n simply mean “right” and “left,” so perhaps some of you are surprised to see them on here. But, as I discussed in my post all about \nnamamono\n, \nmigi\n and \nhidari\n refer to which side of the pairing name a character appears on.\n\nIn western fandom, the order of the pairing name seems to matter less than the vibe of how the name sounds i.e. I’ve seen “xiaoven” (the Genshin ship for Xiao and Venti) refer to Xiao topping, Venti topping, or reversible. In Japanese fandom, however, the ordering of the pairing name is serious business, and the character who tops is on the left, and the character who bottoms is on the right i.e. “Do you like ‘xiaoven’ or ‘venxiao’?” Thus, you might see something like 魈右, or “Xiao \nmigi\n,” meaning the person is only interested in Xiao bottom.\n\n固定（こてい）\nkotei\nKotei\n, meaning “fixed” or “anchored,” refers to someone who only likes content a specific way. For instance, if I said I was トマト固定 (\nthomato kotei)\n, referring to the Genshin ship Thoma/Ayato, it would mean not only do I not want to read content of them with other people, but I also don’t want to read the reverse shipping order. I am only 100% specifically interested in Thoma topping Ayato, and Ayato bottoming for Thoma.\n\n総攻め・総受け（そうぜめ・そううけ）\nsouzeme/sou’uke\nSouzeme\n and \nsou’uke\n is the very BL culture version of saying something like \nmigi kotei\n or \nhidari kotei\n—it means in your heart, a character is either 100% seme or 100% uke. It doesn’t matter what character they’re with, but they should only ever top OR only ever bottom. To use Xiao again, for instance, I could say Xiao is \nsou’uke\n to me, meaning he \nnever\n tops, no matter who he’s with.\n\nリバ・逆（リバ・ぎゃく）\nriba/gyaku\nRiba\n and \ngyaku\n refer to couples that are either 100% reversible, or switch occasionally. \nRiba\n is much more common in a genre sense, and is used more commonly in official and original BL. \n\n雑食（ざっしょく）\nzasshoku\nIf Japanese fandom sounds a bit too strict and intense to you, just know that there are also \nzasshoku\n—“omnivores,” which is the word for multishippers and people who aren’t super particular about the ship, who tops or bottoms, etc. as long as the content is delicious.\n\n====================\n\n地雷（じらい）\njirai\nJirai\n means “landmine,” and it’s the word people use to refer to content that they \nvery\n heavily dislike. It’s similar to “squick” in the West, but quite a lot stronger, and often used in the context that if you post a specific type of content, the person will block you, or if a certain type of content is YOUR \njirai\n then you should block them.\n\nA \njirai\n can be as big as “character death” and as seemingly inconsequential as specific ships or characters. It’s content you absolutely don’t want to see for any reason because it irritates you and ruins your day.\n\nSome very common \njirai\n:\n×\n女体化\n（にょたいか）\nnyotaika\n – depicting one or both characters as female\n×\nリョナ \nryona\n – sometimes referred to as “whump” in the west\n×\n固定（こてい）\nkotei\n – anything that goes against their “fixed” preferences\n\n自衛（じえい）\njiei\nJiei\n simply means self-defense, but it’s a strong belief in online communities that a person is in charge of their \nown\n comfort and happiness online. For this reason, blocking, muting, and putting very clear warnings about what one can expect from following your social media is encouraged. It may seem like gatekeeping from the outside, but it’s to avoid fandom in-fighting and policing.\n\n担当（たんとう）\ntantou\nThe \ntantou\n is usually the head or manager of something, so \ntantou\n is used similar to \noshi\n to indicate your fav, but is often more specific to idol series (particularly older ones like Idol Master, Uta no Prince-sama, and Idolish7). It’s similar to saying “I am the manager of xyz idol.” However, unlike with \noshi\n, the phrasing for \ntantou\n is more restrictive—if I said “Xiao is my \ntantou\n” that would be like saying Xiao is my manager. It can only be the other way around. \n\n同担（どうたん）\ndoutan\nDou\n means “same” and \ntan\n is the same from \ntantou\n, so this essentially means you’re managing the same idol. However, this is also just generally used to refer to people who have the same \noshi\n as you. There are two very important versions of this phrase, though:\n　\n同担歓迎（どうたんかんげい）\ndoutan kangei\n　willing/seeking for friends with the same \noshi\n.\n　\n同担拒否（どうたんきょひ）\ndoutan kyohi\n　doesn’t want to associate with people with the same \noshi\n.\n\n垢（あか）\naka\nAka\n literally just means dirt or grime, but it’s a play on words for the shortened version of アカウント (account). \nAka\n refers to someone’s social media account. For instance, one might have an account specifically for talking about Genshin, so 原神専用垢 (\nGenshin senyou aka\n, or “Genshin-specific account”). It’s particularly common, especially previously, to refer to people’s shit-posting or personal accounts with this kanji.\n\n雑多（ざった）\nzatta\nZatta\n just means “misc.” and is thus generally refers to a multi-fandom account. It’s often used in the insinuation “don’t follow me if you’re only interested in _______” since if you follow this type of account after seeing a bunch of cute Xiao fanart, you’ll end up annoyed when they move on to drawing another fandom next week.\n\n====================\n\nAnyway, that’s all for today! I hope you find these interesting, or useful! Sometimes maneuvering JP fandom can be a bit stressful, since the fandom culture is quite different. Culture shock isn’t only for specifically visiting a country anymore, now that the internet has made everything so easy to access.\n\nAre there any words I didn’t include here that you’ve learned specifically from your fandom? Feel free to post them in the comments, since I’m sure someone will find them useful! I know there are a lot of words I left out, since I didn’t have the time or space, and this was meant to be more informative rather than as a glossary. \n\nShare this:\n\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\n\nX\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\nFacebook\n\nLike\n \nLoading...\n\nRelated\n\n \n\n \n\n Published by \names\n \n\n I love BL manga and cats and cool weather. \n\n View all posts by ames \n\n 5 thoughts on “\nJapanese for NERDS: Oshikatsu, Otakatsu, BLkatsu, and language\n” \n\nLoved this!

Among the most conspicuous is the emergence of \nmenhera\n (a portmanteau of “mental health-er”) girls, female characters who exhibit unstable emotionality, obsessive love, and stereotypical self-injurious behaviors such as wrist cutting. Tracing the expansion of this popular cultural slang since 2000, this conceptual article explores three narrative tropes of \nmenhera\n—the sad girl, the mad woman, and the cutie. Within these \nmenhera\n narratives, self-injury functions as a self-sufficient signifier of female vulnerability, monstrosity, and desire for agency. These \nmenhera\n tropes, each with their unique interpretation of self-injury, have evolved symbiotically with traditional gender norms in Japan, while destabilizing long-standing undesirability of sick/detracted female bodies. The \nmenhera\n narrative tropes mobilize cultural discourses about female madness and subsequently feed back into the social imaginaries, offering those who self-injure symbolic resources for self-interpretation. We argue that popular cultural narratives of self-injury like \nmenhera\n may exert as powerful an influence as clinical discourses on the way we interpret, make sense of, and experience self-injury. Being attentive to cultural representations of self-injury thus can help clinicians move toward compassionate clinical practice beyond the medical paradigm.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSelf-injury, intentional damaging of one's body without a clear suicidal intent, is an enigmatic behavior that breaches boundaries between sanity and madness, physical and mental health (\nChandler, 2014\n). Images of self-injury now surround us, along with voluminous narratives of mental ill-health\n1\n in popular media. Studies have documented the growing number of self-injury portrayals across popular media including films (\nChouinard, 2009\n; \nTrewavas et al., 2010\n; \nDanylevich, 2016\n; \nBareiss, 2017\n), TV shows (\nWhitlock et al., 2009\n), young adult fiction (\nMiskec and McGee, 2007\n) and comics (\nSeko and Kikuchi, 2020\n). Alongside mass media, interactive and visual-rich social media platforms have enabled instant sharing of user-generated self-injury content at an unprecedented speed and scale (\nSeko, 2013\n; \nSeko and Lewis, 2016\n; \nAlderton, 2018\n).\n\nWhile self-injury, with its enhanced visibility, touches many people's lives, the perceived meanings ascribed to this practice vary widely. Research on media portrayals of self-injury has revealed a range of implicit and explicit meanings attached to this practice, including emotional regulation, self-punishment, coping mechanism, interpersonal manipulation, self-affirmation, or resistance to oppression (\nDanylevich, 2016\n; \nBareiss, 2017\n; \nSeko and Kikuchi, 2020\n). Although what self-injury \nmeans\n to the person varies across media narratives, there is a recognizable pattern in \nwho\n engages in this practice. Studies indicate that self-injuring characters in popular media are predominantly female adolescents who self-cut (\nWhitlock et al., 2009\n; \nTrewavas et al., 2010\n; \nRadovic and Hasking, 2013\n). This portrayal reflects and reproduces the medical discourse that has historically associated self-injury with young women and an act of cutting (\nBrickman, 2004\n; \nMillard, 2013\n).\n\nA body of critical sociological research illuminates the long-standing association between self-injury and femininity in clinical literature in which female mental fragility and irrationality is contrasted to the aggressive and violent male pathology (e.g., \nMillard, 2013\n). Statistical “facts” have cemented this “gendered paradox” in suicide (\nCanetto and Sakinofsky, 1998\n), namely, women have higher rates of suicidal ideation and non-fatal suicidal behaviors, whereas suicide mortality is higher for men than women. In modern psychiatry, female self-cutting has thus been framed as a “delicate,” non-fatal self-injury (\nBrickman, 2004\n) that resonated closely with gendered cultural norms on how women should act with and through their bodies. \nChandler and Simopoulou (2021)\n, in their arts-based participatory study, contend that self-inflicted injuries on a female body are often read differently than the same injuries on a male body. Violence acted by women on their bodies elicits “shock, disbelief, disgust,” thereby leading to immediate pathologization (p. 8).\n\nTo date, published research in English on media representations of self-injury has focused almost exclusively on the Anglophone content, paying little attention to non-Anglophone portrayals of self-injury and the role popular media may play in shaping cultural understanding of this practice. However, self-injury has been explicitly thematized in Japanese popular culture over the last few decades. In a previous study, we conducted an extensive search of slice-of-life\n2\n \nmanga\n (graphic novels) published between 2000 and 2017 portraying self-injury in everyday life context (\nSeko and Kikuchi, 2020\n). Across 15 \nmanga\n we examined, the characters engaging in self-injury were predominantly young women cutting themselves to cope with feelings of despair, loneliness, or emotional numbness, replicating research on Anglophone media. However, there were two contrasting perspectives toward young girls who self-injure. On one hand, in \nmanga\n targeting young girls (\nshōjo manga\n), characters engaging in self-injury were primarily protagonists of the narrative who choose self-injury as a maladaptive coping strategy against external pressures (e.g., bullying, oppressive parents). On the other hand, \nmanga\n targeting adult male readers (\nseinen manga\n) portrayed women who self-injure as mentally vulnerable, attractive, and helpless mistresses waiting to be rescued by male protagonists. Notably, many of those female characters in \nseinen manga\n were called \nmenhera\n (a portmanteau of “\nmen\ntal \nheal\nth-\ner\n”) that exhibited unstable emotionality, impulsivity, and sexual promiscuity, along with stereotypical self-injurious behaviors, most often recurrent wrist cutting without a clear suicidal intent (\nSeko and Kikuchi, 2020\n).\n\nIt was around 2014 that we became aware of \nmenhera\n's growing visibility in the Japanese popular cultural landscape, not only in \nmanga\n, but also across \nanime\n (animation) video games, fashion, and character merchandise. Building on our previous study (\nSeko and Kikuchi, 2020\n) and our continuous observation of Japanese popular culture over the past decade, this article provides an initial thought on the emergence of \nmenhera\n narrative tropes, focusing on how self-injury is constructed, appropriated, and repurposed as a metonymy of female madness. We offer a typology of \nmenhera\n by describing the three prevailing narrative tropes: the sad girl who adapts the \nmenhera\n label to self-pathologize their mental angst, the mad woman who exhibits pathetic obsession over her love interest, and the cutie who playfully performs subcultural “sick-cute” aesthetic through fashion. As we will be discussing, these narrative tropes are not mutually exclusive nor occurring discretely; instead, they often converge and inflect one another within one single character and across diverse popular cultural products. We contend that these \nmenhera\n tropes, each with their unique interpretation of self-injury, have evolved symbiotically with the long-standing gender norms in Japan, weaving a complex net of meanings within which female madness is pathologized, fetishized, and performed.\n\nAlthough this article focuses on a Japanese cultural slang as a case in point, our aim is not to ignite an Orientalist discourse around Japanese culture as exotic or peculiar. Rather, given that Japanese \nmanga, anime\n, games, fashion and other popular cultural texts and artifacts have now reached far beyond Japan and exercise significant influences on the cultural landscapes of Asia, North America, and Europe, we aim to ponder on representations of self-injury in popular culture and extrapolate their potential clinical and research implications. In so doing, this article aims to join the growing critical discussion on popular culture's contribution to “pathologization from below” (\nBrinkmann, 2014\n), a process in which popular culture provides a set of semiotic and material practices that shape people's interpretations, feelings, and experiences of mental ill-health. We argue that popular cultural narratives of self-injury like \nmenhera\n may exert as powerful an influence as clinical discourses on the way we interpret, make sense of, and engage with self-injury.\n\nTypology of \nmenhera\n\nThe Origin\n\nThe slang \nmenhera\n was reportedly spawned on the \nmentaru herusu ban\n (mental health board)\n3\n, one of the anonymous discussion boards at a massive online community \n2-channel\n4\n. The mental health board facilitated discussions featuring a wide range of mental health issues including depression, mania, mood disorders, and trauma, among others. Regular users of the discussion board exchanged information about medications, therapies, or local healthcare providers, vented their pent-up feelings, and shared emotional support through anonymous postings. In October 2016, 090, a columnist for an online support network \nmenhera.jp\n, conducted extensive archival research on \n2-channel\n to trace the origin of the term \nmenhera\n. The earliest use of the term dated back to August 2000 when the regulars of the board started describing their community as \nmenheru ban\n, using an abbreviation of \nmentaru herusu\n (mental health) (\n090, 2016a\n). The abbreviation quickly spread among the board members who started calling themselves “\nmenhera\n” (\nmen\ntal \nhealth\n-\ner\n) with the suffix “-er” to indicate their membership to the board. The initial use of the term “\nmenhera\n” thus referred to the board members who self-identified themselves as living with some form of mental ill-health regardless of their diagnosis, gender, and age.\n\nSince the onset of the mental health board, the topic of self-injury has been discussed sporadically among the members. Our observation of the oldest 6,907 threads on the \n2-channel\n mental health board (between November 1999 and July 2001)\n5\n suggests that there were at least 40 threads featuring the topic of self-injury, with the most prominent topic being \nrisuka\n (wrist cutting). The messages posted on these threads entailed a complex set of cutting-related disclosures and advice: some turned to the board to report that they had just self-injured, while others asked for tips to hide scars. Some looked for advice on how to suppress the urge to cut, how to cut safely, or how to support significant others engaging in self-cutting. Notably, none of the 3,792 posts to the 40 threads featuring self-injury included the term \nmenhera\n, which indicates that the link between self-injury and \nmenhera\n was not explicitly established at the dawn of this online slang.\n\nLater, the term \nmenhera\n extended from the mental health board to the broader \n2-channel\n community. According to \n090\n (\n2016a\n), users of other \n2-channel\n boards began using the term around 2003 to refer to the regulars of the mental health board or persons living with mental ill-health in general. By 2005, the term appeared on one of the most popular boards \nnyūsoku VIP ban\n (newsflash VIP board)—notorious for vibrant discussions filled with insider jokes, slander, hate speech, and misogynist remarks. It was likely on the \nnyūsoku VIP ban\n when the term \nmenhera\n was first explicitly linked to women in a pejorative manner. \n090\n (\n2016b\n) identified the emergence of a term \nmenhera onna\n (\nmenhera\n woman) on the \nnyūsoku VIP ban\n which disparagingly referred to women who engage in “pathetic” acts such as extreme mood swings, risky sexual behaviors, and self-injurious acts. One potential reason for this pejorative and gendered connotation was the perceived equation of \nmenhera\n with persons living with borderline personality disorder (BPD) \n090\n (\n2016b\n). BPD is predominantly diagnosed in females (\nGrant et al., 2008\n) and is highly stigmatized within medical communities as “manipulative,” “demanding,” and “attention seeking” (\nAviram et al., 2006\n). By 2008, the term came to derogatively refer to women with “BPD-like” behaviors as troublesome attention seekers from whom “normal” people should keep their distance \n090\n (\n2016b\n).\n\nWith the rapid growth of the Japanese digital landscape, the term \nmenhera\n and its gendered connotation has expanded from the \n2-channel\n subculture to a wider sea of the internet and merged into the mainstream popular culture\n6\n. In May 2021, we searched the term “\nmenhera\n” in three digital databases for Japanese \nmanga, anime\n, and games: the Japan National Diet Library's online catalog (\nhttp://www.ndl.go.jp/\n), the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs' media arts digital archive (\nhttps://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp\n), and Kyoto International Manga Museum's Manga Repository (\nhttp://mmsearch.kyotomm.jp/index_j.html\n). We also searched the term on the App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store (Android) to identify potential gaming apps and visited several online communities featuring Japanese popular culture including 5-channel. Our search identified 27 unique books (14 \nmanga\n, 7 novels, 6 non-fictions) and 5 gaming apps with the term “\nmenhera\n” in their titles, all of which were published in or after 2012. This echoes the study by \nTerada and Watanabe (2021)\n who assessed public interest in \nmenhera\n using Google Trends to evaluate how frequently the term was queried on Google's search engine. They identified that the number of searches rose significantly during 2010-2011 and continued steadily increasing until the time of their writing (January 2021). Despite the fast-paced changes on the internet, this slang has stuck around for a decade and become part of everyday lexicon in Japan, generating three narrative tropes to which we now turn.\n\nThe Sad Girl\n\nThe first \nmenhera\n narrative trope is the sad girl\n7\n, a young woman who struggles with feelings of anxiety, low self-esteem, hopelessness, and loneliness. This narrative focuses on the inner turmoil of girls living with mental angst expressed through a first-person narration of some kind. The sad girl narrative itself pre-dates \nmenhera\n. Since the 1990's, when the Japanese economy suffered a prolonged recession, narratives of psychosocial angst have manifested widely in Japanese popular culture. The term \nikizurasa\n (pain of living) has been used to denote anxiety experienced by many Japanese Millennials struggling with a sense of disconnectedness and self-blaming (\nNae, 2018\n), caused by a vast array of issues from unemployment, poverty, family problems to bullying, social withdrawal and mental ill-health (\nKido, 2016\n). The internet, with its relative anonymity, has provided a haven for people living with life struggles, including those who engage with self-injury. The advancement of user-friendly social media platforms has further provided a fertile ground for \nikizurasa\n monologs to grow and multiply.\n\nThe term \nmenhera\n, with its association with femininity, has a considerable appeal to young women struggling with \nikizurasa. One\n of the earliest examples is an indie \nmanga\n titled \nMenhera-chan\n written by then 14-year-old Kotoha Toko\n8\n who started posting an autobiographical \nmanga\n on her personal website around 2010. With the support from a professional editor who discovered her website, Kotoha published the \nmanga\n in two-volume book format (\nKotoha, 2012\n). In this coming-of-age \nmanga\n, the female protagonist \nMenhera-chan\n (“the \nmenhera\n girl”) is a junior high school student experiencing long-term school refusal and social withdrawal due to undiagnosed depression. Two other main characters, \nKenkou-kun\n (“the healthy boy”) and \nByoujaku-chan\n (“the frail girl”), become friends with \nMenhera-chan\n and offer her emotional support and encouragement. Although \nMenhera-chan\n does not engage in self-injury, there are repeated references to suicide by overdose and self-strangulation that provides a strong link between \nmenhera\n and self-destructive acts.\n\nWhen asked why she wrote \nMenhera-chan\n, Kotoha commented in an interview:\n\n“When I looked around myself, I realized that there were quite a few people who easily cry or feel hurt. People who live normally may wonder about these people like ‘Why do you cry over such a small thing?' or tell them ‘Don't feel hurt by such a thing!' But even those who think they have nothing to do with ‘\nmenhera\n' never know who would become the one, and indeed some people may step in the realm before they know it. This is why I wrote \nMenhera-chan\n with the hope that readers would think ‘Ah, I can relate' or ‘I can understand \nMenhera-chan\n's feelings”' (\nDa Vinci News, 2013\n).\n\nFor Kotoha who has personally experienced bullying and social withdrawal, \nmenhera\n is a liminal state of being that anyone can “step in” at any time. This subtle normalization proposes an antithesis to the prevailing marginalization of social misfits who, due to various reasons, deviate from the mainstream Japanese career and life path of getting a stable job, having a family, and becoming a responsible citizen (\nNae, 2018\n). Nevertheless, by naming the protagonist \nMenhera-chan\n, the author explicitly pathologized the prevailing \nikizurasa\n among young women. \nMenhera\n girls “easily cry or feel hurt” because of their morbid individual pathology, which should be frowned upon and discouraged by “people who live normally.” It is also noteworthy that this \nmanga\n ends with the protagonist overcoming her long-term school refusal and attending a part-time high school. By describing the protagonist's gradual return to the normative social trajectory, \nKotoha (2012)\n frames the mentally unhealthy girlhood as part of the passage to adulthood—which can be managed with time and optimal support from significant others.\n\nAnother notable sad girl narrative comes from a series of graphic narratives posted on Twitter by a young illustrator Momose Asami under the username @\nmenherashoujo\n (\nmenhera\n girl). Since 2013 Momose has tweeted one illustration a day, featuring a mouthless girl in a sailor suit (school uniform). Unlike \nKotoha (2012)\n \nmanga\n which is drawn in a comic strip format, Momose's work is a single panel comic that depicts a girl suffering loneliness, sadness, and despair. Most images are accompanied with a few spoken lines of the \nmenhera\n girl's monolog or a short dialogue between her and anonymous others who seemingly do not understand what the girl is struggling with. Although it is not described whether the \nmenhera\n girl has a diagnosable mental disorder or what is causing her angst, self-injury (wrist cutting) is depicted as a way for the \nmenhera\n girl to cope with inner pain or to manage a dissociative feeling to make sure she is still alive (\nFigure 1\n). As of May 2021, Momose's Twitter account has over 85,000 followers and the collection of her illustrations was published in a book titled “The Voice of a Gray Girl” (\nMomose, 2016\n).\n\nFIGURE 1\n\n \n\nFigure 1\n. “Doesn't wrist-cutting hurt?” “It doesn't hurt (as much as my heart).” A graphic narrative posted on Twitter by Momose Asami (@menherashoujo). Image reproduced with permission from the author.\n\nThese sad girl narratives indicate that the slang provided the creators with a relatively neutral and all-encompassing label to portray contemporary Japanese girls struggling with the pain of living. It deserves attention that the sad girl \nmenhera\n embodies stereotypical Japanese femininity, such as submissiveness, self-control, and free of selfishness. \nMomose (2016)\n mouthless character eloquently suggests that the \nmenhera\n girl suffers in silence; everything we see and hear about her is through her inner monolog filled with despair and distress, but she has no voice to raise. Self-injury is depicted as a means to externalize and cope with her inner pain, rather than communicating her angst to others. Momose's depiction of the \nmenhera\n girl as a “gray girl” is particularly telling in this regard. In her study on media portrayals of eating disorders and self-harm among Japanese women, \nHansen (2011)\n asserts that women in contemporary Japan often face “the paradox of navigating contradictive femininity in a gray zone between the normal and the disordered” (p. 57). To be “the good and clean girl” requires Japanese women to exercise rigid self-control over their bodies to “suppress the evil” in themselves (\nHansen, 2011\n, p. 61). In the sad girl narratives, self-harming actions such as self-induced regurgitation, starvation, and self-cutting are portrayed as a borderline disordered act performed by young women attempting to navigate the contradictive femininity.\n\nParadoxically, the link between \nmenhera\n and stereotypical femininity has resulted in \nmenhera\n's sudden upsurge in popularity, particularly within \nmanga/anime\n targeting male audiences. For example, \nLast Menhera\n (\nAmano and Ise, 2016\n) is a \nseinen manga\n (young male comic) that follows a high school boy falling in love with a beautiful classmate who self-cuts (\nFigure 2\n). Throughout the story, the heroine engages in recurring wrist slashing to “endure the pain of living” and “postpone the decision [to commit suicide]” (\nAmano and Ise, 2016\n, p. 56) which leads other characters to label her \nmenhera\n. The male protagonist pretends that he, too, self-injures to attract her attention and affection. Through the protagonist's male gaze, the heroine's scarred body becomes the object of affective consumption wherein self-injury symbolizes her vulnerability, helplessness, and deformity, which altogether constitutes a twisted sexual appeal (\nSeko and Kikuchi, 2020\n).\n\nFIGURE 2\n\n \n\nFigure 2\n. \nLast menhera\n (\nAmano and Ise, 2016\n) features a male protagonist who falls in love with a \nmenhera\n girl. Image reproduced with permission from the publisher Futaba-sha.\n\nThe Mad Woman\n\nWhereas, the sad girl narrative domesticates female madness as vulnerable and potentially erotic, the mad woman exaggerates her abnormality and derangement, particularly in the context of romantic relationships. In this narrative, the \nmenhera\n is obsessed with her love interest and makes devastating efforts to be with this person. Intriguingly, in many \nmanga, anime\n, and games, \nmenhera\n girls are first introduced as cute, loveable, and nurturing to their love interests. However, when a third person gets into the equation, their insecurity manifests as possessive thoughts and actions, overprotectiveness, and extreme jealousy that appears eccentric and terrifying to others (\nKato, 2018\n). Unlike the sad girls who walk a tightrope between the normal and the disordered, the mad woman firmly inhabits the realm of madness.\n\nIn the mad woman \nmenhera\n narrative, self-injury is often depicted as an act of interpersonal manipulation. For example, in her autobiographical self-help book titled “All Girls are \nMenhera\n,” self-identified “former” \nmenhera\n \nSuisui (2020)\n reflects her wrist cutting as motivated by an intense fear of abandonment. Whenever she needed reassurance, she self-cut in front of her boyfriend or sent him photos of her bleeding wounds. Although \nSuisui (2020)\n does not specify whether she had a diagnosable disorder, this self-mockery reflects the long-standing negative stereotype attached to people with BPD, the connotation first established in popular \n2-channel\n threads and expanded to mainstream popular culture—\nmenhera\n as troublesome attention seekers (\n090\n, \n2016b\n). The mad woman may also commit violence toward others, from verbal aggression to physical expressions, to perform her devotion to the beloved. Across recent \nmanga, anime\n, and games, \nmenhera\n girls are frequently portrayed as holding a sharp weapon indicating that their jealous aggression can be easily turned onto others (for an example of this caricature, see \nKurii, 2016\n)\n9\n.\n\nAnother salient and stereotypical caricature of the mad woman takes the form of her obsessive communication style. \nMenhera\n girls are often portrayed as engaging in digital stalking through relentless texting and social media monitoring to check their lovers' whereabouts and make sure they are always within reach. This “pathetic” behavior has become the subject of mockery and even gamification. For example, in 2016 rock band Mio Yamazaki released an Artificial Intelligence (AI) named \nMenhera\n Girlfriend as part of a promotional campaign for their new album (\nhttp://ai-girl-mio.jp/\n). This program allowed users to chat with a bot that sends sarcastic and depressive messages representative of \nmenhera\n personality. If a player does not respond quickly, the AI would text “Why don't you respond?” “Don't you love me?” or “Do you mean I should die?” imitating a \nmenhera\n girl going emotionally awry.\n\nSimilarly, a mobile gaming app named “\nMenhera\n Girlfriend and One Million Text Messages” features obsessive texting between a \nmenhera\n girl and her boyfriend (\nFigure 3\n). In this game, the player takes the role of a \nmenhera\n girl and sends an excessive amount of text messages to her boyfriend. The player earns points as they send a text and can exchange points for items and decorations. Items are saturated with satire and dark humor, including surveillance cameras that help monitor the boyfriend 24/7, or an assassin to eliminate any person who has a crush on the boyfriend. Launched in February 2014, the gaming app has reached 500,000 downloads in <1 year (\nHappy, Gamer Inc, 2015\n)\n10\n.\n\nFIGURE 3\n\n \n\nFigure 3\n. A screenshot of mobile game “\nmenhera\n girlfriend and one million messages.” The green speech bubbles represent excessive amounts of text messages from the \nmenhera\n girlfriend character. Image reproduced with permission from Happy Gamer Inc.\n\nIn these examples, the narrative trope is deployed in ways that disdain and embellish the girl, isolating “pathetic” behaviors within the individual. Whether she is struggling with mental ill-health no longer matters—the emotional blackmailing, obsessive texting and manipulative self-injury alone prove she \nis\n a \nmenhera\n. Further, the mad woman embodies a dualism between gender norms and deviation from them. On one hand, she opposes normative gender constructions by exhibiting aggression and violence historically associated with stereotypical masculinity. Her obsessive and assertive behavior appears frightening, immoral, and unfeminine. Yet on the other hand, her character trait still resonates with normative femininity in that her obsession with the beloved, albeit distasteful, can be seen embodying a feminine value of selfless devotion. In this regard, the mad woman \nmenhera\n trope represents what \nChouinard (2009)\n calls “postmodern monstrosity” associated with female madness. Analyzing film portrayals of mad womanhood, \nChouinard (2009)\n argues that mad women are depicted as horrific because they evoke deep-seated fears that “the monstrous other is always already inside the self” (p. 799). Similarly, the \nmenhera\n girl simultaneously embodies the menace long associated with mental ill-health and the all-too-human desire to love, care for, and nurture. With the innate moral and aesthetical ambiguity, she becomes a postmodern monster.\n\nThe Cutie\n\nThe final narrative trope is the cutie who embodies an emergent aesthetic of \nyami-kawaii\n (sick-cute), a subculture originating in Harajuku, a district in Tokyo known as the mecca of youth countercultures (\nRefinery29, 2018\n). As a portmanteau combining \nyami\n (sick, dark) with \nkawaii\n (cute), \nyami-kawaii\n mixes traditional cute elements with dark and grotesque motifs; pink hearts, strawberries, fluffy stuffed animals are juxtaposed with knives, blood splatters, hangman's nooses, syringes, pills, as well as suicidal slogans and swearwords (\nRefinery29, 2018\n). Practitioners of \nyami-kawaii\n fashion often feign injury by wearing bandages and eye patches or carrying syringes and needles as accessories. \nYami-kawaii\n makeup emphasizes a mental illness motif, including “sickly pale” foundation and red blush-lined eyes to make them “look like swollen from crying” to express the mental angst and “the need of comfort” (\nTerada and Watanabe, 2021\n). At the heart of this girl's subculture lies a proposition: \nmenhera\n is cute.\n\nIllustrator Ezaki Bisko is often credited to have popularized the \nyami-kawaii\n movement through his character \nMenhera-chan\n. Created in 2013 as a simple doodle posted on Twitter, the character has quickly gained popularity and expanded into a \nmanga\n series on Pixiv, an illustration-based online community (\nEzaki, 2018\n). The \nmanga\n features a group of schoolgirls who transform into justice heroines by slashing their wrists with a magical box cutter. The protagonist \nMenhera Pink\n and other “\nrisuka senshi\n (wrist cut warriors)” are big-eyed, lovely-faced girls in pastel-colored sailor suits with their wrists bandaged (indicating self-injury). They fight evil spirits that lure people into derangement, while concealing their real identities (i.e., ordinary schoolgirls) during the day (\nEzaki, 2018\n). It imitates the magical girl fantasy, a well-established \nmanga/anime\n genre that features metamorphosis that turns an ordinary girl into a super powered alter ego.\n\nAlthough it follows the convention of the magical girl genre, the cutie \nmenhera\n strategically disrupts traditionally innocuous \nkawaii\n culture through its encapsulation of mental angst and re-appropriation of self-injury. The portrayal of wrist cutting as a ritual for transformation is deliberate and provocative, oozing with dark humor. It is neither a red-flag symptom of mental morbidity nor a gesture of interpersonal manipulation, but a simple means of magical transformation to defeat evil spirits/mental illness. The \nmenhera\n girls are not mad or deranged, because mental illness has been detached and externalized as villains and it is their mission as justice warriors to defeat the evil. Rather than romanticizing or pathologizing self-injury, they calmly slash their arms to do their job.\n\nFrom its onset, the cutie \nmenhera\n narrative has been accompanied by a unique material culture. Ezaki Bisko has produced various character merchandise featuring \nMenhera Pin\nk and fellow wrist cut warriors since 2014. Many of the frilly, pastel-colored clothing and kitsch accessories carry provocative messages like “kill you,” “sick,” or “death” representing the duality of \nyami kawaii\n aesthetic (\nRefinery29, 2018\n). Among the \nMenhera\n-chan merchandise, the most controversial was the “\nrisuka\n bangle” (wrist-cut bracelet) that emulated gaping wounds caused by self-cutting. Produced by an indie brand Conpeitou in collaboration with Ezaki in October 2014, the bracelet was sold out quickly. The brand then made an announcement of a resale on Twitter in June 2015 (\nConpeitou, 2015a\n). However, this time it caused a storm of criticism on social media, resulting in immediate discontinuation of the product (\nConpeitou, 2015b\n). On the company's blog, the designer commented that they, too, had a long-term experience with self-injury and apologized to those who were offended by the idea of treating self-injury as a fashion item (\nConpeitou, 2015b\n).\n\nWhereas, the wrist-cut bracelet and other \nMenhera\n-chan merchandise have stirred criticism as trivializing self-injury and other “serious” issues behind the act, the idea of wearable/removable self-cuts paradoxically suggests the subversive potential of cute aesthetics. In the cutie \nmenhera\n trope, the \nyami-kawaii\n outfits and accessories can work as a sugar-coating layer to communicate one's inner turmoil and social discomfort in a playful and exaggerated manner. Drawing attention to its superficial materiality, the cutie \nmenhera\n plays resistance to a “symptomatic” reading, which assumes a text's truest meaning is not immediately apprehensible and must be unveiled by an expert interpreter (\nBest and Marcus, 2009\n). Against the medico-political proposition that there must be a “real” issue buried beneath one's self-injury, the wrist-cut bracelet reduces self-injury to the depthless surface, rendering it commodifiable, consumable, and thus controllable body work through the façade of cuteness.\n\nThis assertive, in-your-face cuteness of the cutie \nmenhera\n embodies what Sharon \nKinsella (1995)\n calls a “rebellious, individualistic, freedom-seeking attitude” (p. 229) of Japanese \nkawaii\n culture. However, whereas \nKinsella (1995)\n puts an emphasis on the infantile, escapist dimension of \nkawaii\n by equating being cute with behaving childlike, \nMenhera Pin\nk and wrist cut warriors engage in aggressive social commentary through their bloody fight against mental illness (evil spirits). Likewise, the practitioners of \nyami-kawaii\n fashion refute the premises of the medical model that casts self-injury as a self-evident sign of pathology. The scars and wounds could be read as a removable accessary, rather than unwanted marks of individual morbidity. Regarding the subversive potential of cute, \nBrzozowska-Brywczyńska (2007)\n contends that cute aesthetic embodies the Foucauldian heterotopia—“the place outside the norm, the site of revolutionary potential to change, to post an alternative order, where the coherence between words and reality is no more possible, where the paradox is structuring rule” (p. 225). As a heterotopic being, the cutie \nmenhera\n may perform the agentic self by pushing back against the pathologization long associated with female self-injury.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOver the past few decades, the slang \nmenhera\n has gained unique versatility to travel across the Japanese popular cultural landscape. Even though the term initially referred to a self-label for a person living with mental ill-health, a multitude of interpretations have emerged over time, transforming \nmenhera\n into a multivocal discourse. All three narrative tropes examined in this article are entangled with sociocultural constructions of mad womanhood in Japan. \nMenhera\n girls in some ways reproduce and reinforce traditional gender norms, while in other ways disrupt the framing of women with mental ill-health as abnormal others. Pejorative connotations associated with self-injury, such as attention-seeking, manipulative, and obsessive, mobilize the normative discourse that demonizes female aggression. Simultaneously, \nmenhera\n embody traditional femininity such as submissiveness, silence, and selfless devotion, which paradoxically enhances the desirability of \nmenhera\n girls as an object of affective consumption.\n\nEventually, \nmenhera\n has become part of what cultural critic \nAzuma (2009)\n metaphorically calls a postmodern “database” of cultural imaginaries. The database offers content creators an attractive caricature, a dramatic tool, and a source of plots with handy narrative tropes to draw from, while providing audiences with a rich repository of affective stimuli to satisfy their drives (\nAzuma, 2009\n). Within the database, \nmenhera\n becomes an archetype of contemporary female madness that can be consumed with little need of backstories and contextual knowledge. A series of personality traits attached to the slang \nmenhera\n (e.g., preoccupied attachment style, insecurity, excessive jealousy) are essentialized, caricatured, and sexualized, shaping the collective understanding of what \nmenhera\n girls \nare\n and \ndo\n. Self-injury is framed as an iconic act that confirms \nmenhera\n girls' abnormality, which in turn triggers a series of pre-packaged responses from contempt, pity, abhorrence, to attraction and fetish.\n\nOnce integrated into this ever-expanding database, the \nmenhera\n tropes play a powerful role in shaping one's experience with self-injury. Just as psychiatric diagnoses provide those facing life problems with “languages of suffering” to narrate their experiences (\nBrinkmann, 2014\n), the \nmenhera\n tropes may mobilize a set of understandings and potential actions distinct from clinical conceptualizations. In her study with female college students in Tokyo, \nMatsuzaki (2017)\n found that 13% of survey respondents had used the word \nmenhera\n in daily conversation to refer to themselves. Matsuzaki posits that mental health slangs like \nmenhera\n may provide people with a convenient frame of reference to understand and describe subjective experiences of mental ill-health. Here, the label \nmenhera\n may work metonymically to protect the persons who adapt it, since wearing it enables them to instantly perform a “mentally unhealthy” identity without disclosing actual medical diagnoses (if any) or the reason for their angst. For women who self-injure, it may be at times easier to call themselves \nmenhera\n to self-pathologize their abject self than to ponder root causes of their mental angst pertinent to the contemporary Japanese society – such as the patriarchal social system, the lack of equality caused by a widening socio-economic gap, and the pressures of economic deprivation (\nNae, 2018\n).\n\nThis process can be understood as what Ian Hacking has called “classifications of people” in that a system of classification formulates general truths about people's suffering (\nHacking, 2004\n). Drawing on Hacking's work, \nMillard (2013)\n argues that gendered pathology of self-cutting may exert powerful influence over women who self-injure. Millard notes: “as self-harm becomes further entrenched as ‘female cutting,' the more people gendered as female have access to a resonant behavioral pattern said to signify ‘distress”' (p. 136). Similarly, through the \nmenhera\n tropes, self-injury can be culturally recognized as a mean for women to externalize \nikizurasa\n (pain of living), which simultaneously frames self-injury as a self-sufficient act to classify a woman as \nmenhera\n. However, \nHacking (2004)\n further argues that the dialectic between classifications and people classified is rather dynamic and cyclical. When people interact with systems of classification, those who classified “cause systems of classification to be modified in turn” (p. 279), a feedback mechanism that he coined “looping effects.”\n\nIn the light of this looping effect, the intersection of mental health and female counterculture is worth further exploration. We have argued that the cutie \nmenhera\n embodies an inherent tension associated with the cute aesthetics between reproducing and subverting the existing social order. Although there is an understandable concern that their sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek attitude toward self-injury and mental illness may trivialize or fetishize the issue, the cutie \nmenhera\n's impulse to “cute-ify” the socially abject self—as a commodity amenable to change—can potentially disrupt pathological judgment ascribed to them. The cutificaction process may provide the opportunity for people who self-injure to open spaces for vocality and performance apart from the medical model that renders a clinical approach as the only appropriate way to make sense of self-injury. We thus echo \nKato (2018)\n proposition that \nyami-kawaii\n (sick-cute) culture may destabilize the long-standing undesirability of sick/detracted female bodies. The practitioners of \nmenhera\n fashion seem to thrive on dialectical oppositions: cute and ugly, engaged and apathetic, wild and tame, subordination and resistance to chauvinist fantasies. With the ambivalence at the heart of their aesthetics, the cutie \nmenhera\n cheekily questions: What's wrong with being mentally ill?\n\nNonetheless, the politically subversive potential of the \nmenhera\n subculture requires a cautious observation to avoid blind celebration or denigration. The cutie \nmenhera\n's social commentary is considerably limited to the realm of cisgender and heterosexist normativity. Their aesthetic focuses primarily on an idealized feminine cuteness and deviance from it, while little attention is paid to social class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, dis/ability, and other identity makers that may ascribe different meanings to self-injury and female madness. It would be fruitful for future research to apply an intersectional lens that takes into account material and discursive socio-political contexts that inform theorization of mad womanhood. Moreover, the \nmenhera\n-the-cutie subculture is deeply entangled with consumerism that equates empowerment with the capacity to purchase. As \nMooney (2018)\n comments on girls' digital subcultures, subversive identity performances by youth sometime end up swallowed by mainstream consumer culture. Given the widening socio-economic gap in Japan, future theoretical work should interrogate who has access to the subversive readings of self-injury and mental health, while others may fall into the prey of poverty and poverty shaming.\n\nConclusion\n\nToday, \nmenhera\n girls abound in Japanese popular culture in many forms and manifestations. One may encounter them in \nmanga, anime\n, games as well as clothing, makeup, and other character merchandise. Within the three narrative tropes examined in this article—the sad girl, the mad woman, and the cutie—self-injury functions as an iconic signifier of women's vulnerability, monstrosity, and desire for control over their bodies. Even though the act is strongly associated with one's mental ill-health, in these narrative tropes it also represents a deviant performance and a tongue-in-cheek statement of agency that troubles the pathological reading of the practice.\n\nGiven the ongoing dialectic between popular cultural classification and people classified, developing an intersectional, cross-disciplinary understanding of how popular culture represents self-injury has implications for clinical practice and research. Just like any other human behavior, clinical practices do not exist in a cultural vacuum. When people use cultural slangs like \nmenhera\n to explain their engagement with self-injury, they may attempt to narrate their pain of living that cannot be captured by a medical frame of reference. Their vernacular illness narrative can then feed back into the clinical system of classification and shape clinical providers' understanding of what self-injury \nis\n and \ndoes\n. In this regard, we concur with \nChandler (2014)\n assertion that attending to the diverse ways in which self-injury is understood and narrated “should comprise an important aspect of compassionate clinical practice” (p. 5). Exploring the cultural milieu wherein people explain, perform, and make sense of self-injury can illuminate important conversations occurring outside of the clinical practice that have considerable influence on people who self-injure and those who are affected by it.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nBoth authors have made a substantial and intellectual contribution to the work and approved the submitted manuscript.\n\nFunding\n\nThis work was supported by Ryerson University Faculty of Communication and Design under a new faculty start-up fund granted to YS.\n\nConflict of Interest\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\nPublisher's Note\n\nAll claims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated organizations, or those of the publisher, the editors and the reviewers.

Our use of this terminology is informed by our positionality that mirrors that of critical health communication and disability studies. It is also reflective of our experience working with people with lived experiences of self-injury.\n\n2. \n^\nSlice-of-life \nmanga\n (\nnichijō-kei in Japanese\n) \nrefers to a narrative genre that features realistic depictions of everyday, mundane life\n.\n\n3. \n^\nIn 2017, along with the transfer of ownership, all 2-channel past logs were opened to the public for free. According to the \n2-channel\n archives (\nhttps://mevius.5ch.net/utu/kako/kako0000.html\n), the mental health board was launched on November 21, 1999 by Nishimura Hiroyuki, the founder of 2-channel as “\nsou-utsu ban\n” (manic-depressive board). As of May 18, 2021, there were 75,987 threads posted under the mental health board with each thread hosting up to 1,000 posts.\n\n4. \n^\n2-channel\n changed its name to \n5-channel\n in 2017.\n\n5. \n^\nSince 1999, the mental health board has been hosted on 16 different servers. Most of the oldest threads were on a server named “piza” (\nhttps://piza.5ch.net/utu/kako/\n) that hosted a total of 6907 threads between November 1991 to July 2001. We went through the titles of 6907 threads and took a closer look at posts made to the 40 threads that include “\nrisuto kat\n (wrist cutting)” “\nrisuka\n (a portmanteau of \nrisu\nto\n \nka\nt\n)” or “\njisho\n (self-injury)” in their titles.\n\n6. \n^\nAround the same time, the term \nmenhera\n also generated art subculture among artists living with mental ill-health. Between 2014-16, a group of artists in Tokyo started applying this label to their work and organizing a yearly art fair called “\nMenhera\n Exhibit” to display and sell their “outsider art” (\nTAV Gallery, 2016\n).\n\n7. \n^\nThe term “sad girl” may remind some readers of the Sad Girls movement that had gone viral across North American social media around 2014-15. Digital artist Audrey Wollen (@tragicqueen), who is credited with coining the term “Sad Girl Theory” in 2014, claimed that the sadness of girls should be re-historicized as an act of resistance (\nTunnifliffe, 2015\n). Wollen's online performance of sadness, chronic illness, and depression can be considered a protest against the liberal feminist ideal of “Girl Power” that emphasizes women's will-power despite patriarchal social structures. By framing women/girls as responsible for their own success, the Girl Power discourse was criticized as denying and pathologizing women's sadness (\nMooney, 2018\n). Although there are certainly commonalities between the (White) Sad Girl movement and the sad girl \nmenhera\n, the latter is oriented more toward pathologization of female fragility and conformity to cultural norms rather than resistance to and disruption of such norms.\n\n8. \n^\nIn this article we present Japanese names in the Japanese convention – the family name (surname) followed by the given name (first name).\n\n9. \n^\nIn Japanese subculture, this caricature is sometimes called “\nyandere\n,” a portmanteau of “\nyanderu\n” (sick) and “\nderedere\n” (lovestruck), referring to a deranged girl who uses violence or brutality to express her obsessive love. \nKato (2018)\n argues that \nyandere\n embodies borderline personality disorder, while \nmenhera\n is “in the type of narcissistic personality disorder” (p. 47). Although we disagree with this blunt and pseudo-medical dualism, it is worth noting that \nyandere\n girl is an exaggerated caricature of \nmenhera\n girl with strong emphasis on her brutality.\n\n10. \n^\nIn June 2015, the company changed the game title to “\nYuru-yami\n girlfriend and one million messages” where the term \nyuru-yami\n (loosely sick) replaced \nmenhera\n. While Happy Gamer Inc. did not specify the reason for this decision, the game's official twitter alluded that Apple's app store policies might have led to the title change.

So I've come across the term landmine or mine woman when looking through \nwear.jp\n today (I'm a fan of Japanese fashions). It was a tag on someone's outfit, so I clicked it and girly and goth style coords popped up. I also saw the term several weeks ago when looking at Japanese makeup videos (the girl was going a dark girly style of makeup). What exactly does this term mean? When I googled 地雷女 a bunch of dating advice articles popped up saying this is the type of woman to avoid. But it seems like an extreme stereotype and not an actual personality type. Also, girls seem to be labeling themselves/ their style with this term, but I'm not sure if they're doing it unironically or not. Is this term just a joke or is it kind of insulting (like otaku)?\n \n\n Note: I don't know how to read katakana or hiragana, I just use google translate when searching things in Japanese.\n \n\n Read more\n \n \n\n \n\n Archived post.

As \"landmine\" is almost always used in negative context towards a person and to harass or demean, there has been controversy surrounding the name.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\n While the term has seen some use in Japanese media as a sales point, it is still seen as derogatory to the degree that the staff of various companies refuse to work on anything related to the term or trend.\n[\n6\n]\n\nWomen within the subculture are called \"Jirai Joshi\" (地雷女子), or landmine girls, while men in the subculture are referred to as \"Jirai Danshi\" (地雷男子), or landmine boys.\n\nOrigins and Controversy\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nDue to a makeup challenge by Japanese YouTuber SuReRo\n[\n7\n]\n that went viral during the March 2020 corona restrictions in Japan, which was about emulating the \"landmine woman\" stereotype, the term has been associated with various darker styles, gradually morphing into its own subculture.\n[\n8\n]\n\nJirai Kei has strong associations with some darker or disturbing themes, though not in the style on its own like \nYami Kawaii\n. In this case, Jirai Kei may be associated with self-harm, drug abuse, alcoholism, street partying, illegal sex work, and other rebellious and shocking behaviors. The associations of this kind of behavior with Jirai Kei is said to have its roots among the Toyoko Kids - a criminal gang mainly consisting out of teenage runaways that is active in Kabukicho, furthering its negative connotations.\n[\n9\n]\n Many criticize that Jirai Kei has contributed to harmful real life consequences, such as teens and young adults being groomed into self-destructive behavior in order to get accepted within the subculture.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\n\nThere's also arguments to be made for the supposed appropriation of the \"landmine\" stereotype by both Japanese and overseas followers of Jirai Kei as solely a fashion trend. Elements commonly associated with the stereotype are often emulated and romanticized as a quirky gimmick solely for aesthetic reasons.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n13\n]\n Meanwhile, those who engage in substance usage, self-harm, and sex work face criticism and demonization from others into Jirai Kei, especially overseas netizens, who wish to renounce them after accusations of Jirai Kei promoting problematic behavior by outsiders.\n[\n14\n]\n In response, some contend that Jirai Kei followers who engage in problematic behavior, labeled as \"lifestyle landmines\", are the true originators of the subculture and therefore should not be disowned from the community solely for the sake of maintaining the reputation of those who insist on only participating in the associated aesthetics of the subculture, labeled as \"fashion landmines\".\n\nDue to the controversies related to the Jirai Kei subculture, people both within Japan as well overseas have stated that it should be no longer promoted in reference to styles and trends as its the fashion part is already mostly encompassed in \nDark Girly\n and \nYami Kawaii.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n15\n]\n\nStyle Basics\n[\n]\n\nJirai Kei as a style has a strong focus on the overall styling rather than the clothes on their own, and therefore the fashions worn can vary to a high degree depending on the current common trends within the subculture.\n\nClothes\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStyles commonly worn by Jirai girls over the years.\n \n \nSince the initial boom in 2020, Jirai Kei has expanded into multiple directions and now covers a wide range of styles. The classic Jirai Kei outfit features \nGirly\n fashion and emphasizes a feminine yet mysterious aura with a focus on the color combination of black with muted pink, but occasionally also red or white.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n16\n]\n High collared blouses are being worn with a frilly high waist skirt and the clothes are often accented with lace and frills.\n[\n1\n]\n An alternative winter version of the style swaps the frilly blouse with a lacey sweater. Gemstone jewelry often includes rhinestones and pearls. Some of the most popular platform shoe choices are platform loafers and, more commonly, Mary Jane platform clogs (both are usually chosen from around 3 inches to 5 inches of back heel length). Lace trim socks or dark tights are be worn under the shoes.\n\nAs the initial look associated with Jirai Kei became mainstream, it started to move on to edgier alternative fashion looks.\n[\n3\n]\n The outfits of this type are generally unisex and often incorporate oversized \nYami Kawaii\n tops with their typical prints, the most popular being depictions of sick or injured stuffed animals, that are worn like a dress and reach a little below the thigh area. There's also many \nGoth Punk\n elements with ripped sweaters, bondage elements, fishnet tights, and massive platform shoes.\n[\n17\n]\n Tracksuits are also occasionally worn in combination with leg warmers or loose socks. Black is still in the central focus for the clothes but with vibrant colors such as red, blue, or purple, as accents. \n\nHair and Makeup\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nTypical \"namida bukuro\" makeup.\n \n \n\nJirai Kei makeup often resembles a highly exaggerated version of byojaku makeup with the typical pink or red under eye blush, emphasized tear bags, down-turned black eyeliner, and overall pale makeup foundation. Black circle lens contacts are commonly worn to make the eyes appear bigger, lipstick colors can vary based on how the wearer decides.\n[\n1\n]\n\nFor hairstyles, hime cut bangs, twin-tails with the ends curled (also referred to as pigtails), and black hair with highlights are most common, though many Japanese Jirai girls also dye strands of their hair to a darker pink color, or use colored extensions. Cute nail art (black and white being the most common colors) with gems and 3D art are also usually seen, especially incorporating Sanrio themes.\n\nAccessories\n[\n]\n\nCommon accessories in Jirai Kei include long black satin hair bows, Miu Miu bracelets, variants of the saturn logo necklace from Vivienne Westwood, a Jill Stuart handbag or MCM logo backpack in pale pink, as well as various types of Sanrio character accessories, most often featuring the characters My Melody or Kuromi.\n[\n1\n]\n Miss Dior perfume bottles are also vastly popular and a common perfume choice. Older adult women invested in the fashion sense can also seen drinking various types of alcohol, like \"Strong Zero\" with a straw, presumably to not disturb their makeup.\n[\n13\n]\n\nAttitude\n[\n]\n\nOn top of the style standing out, Jirai Kei also has a unique attitude of wanting to be in charge, or pushing to be seen and recognized. This slightly rebellious attitude is often seen in those who wear the style; underage high school girls can be seen smoking, drinking, and wandering city streets at night as part of this behavior. It also has ties to even darker themes, such as public promotion of self harm and underage prostitution (see the above \nControversy\n section).\n\nPopularity\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nManga cover featuring Yua Takahashi from \"Tomorrow, I'll Be Someone's Girlfriend\" (明日、私は誰かのカノジョ)\n \n \n\nDespite Jirai Kei being a younger and controversial subculture, it has seen some rise in popularity. Particularly, it has been covered by online magazines who reported about celebrities taking part in the initial makeup challenge, as well as featured by Japanese influencers and beauty gurus who created makeup tutorials for archiving the various looks.\n[\n8\n]\n During the height of its popularity, Jirai Kei's initial style has also been worn by the popular Japanese model Tsubasa Masuwaka, and she described it as \"cute with a gothic edge\".\n[\n18\n]\n\nAlthough it hasn't gained much media traction overseas, Jirai Kei has been mentioned a bit in various English media.\n[\n8\n]\n There also has been a slight increase of general awareness about the subculture due to the drama adaption of the manga \"Tomorrow, I Will Be Someone's Girlfriend\" with the character \"Yua\" representing both the stereotype as well as the style. Music featuring Jirai Kei characters has also become popular in the mainstream, with songs such as DECO*27's \"The Vampire\" featuring Hatsune Miku dressing and acting as a landmine girl reaching nearly 70M views as of late 2023.\n[\n19\n]\n\nBrands & Shops\n[\n]\n\nAnk Rouge\n\nAmilige\n\nBubbles\n\nDarrdy\n\nDearMyLove\n\nLafary\n\nLiz Lisa\n\nMA*RS\n\nNoemie\n\nReflem\n\nRojita\n\nSubcul Zirai\n\nTravas Tokyo\n\nViviene Westwood\n\nYosuke USA\n\nGallery\n[\n]\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n↑ \n1.0\n \n1.1\n \n1.2\n \n1.3\n \n\"Appearing all over Kabukicho!

It is primarily associated with young people frequenting the nightlife of Kabukichō. Initially, the style closely resembled the darker variant of \nJapanese Girly\n fashion during its peak popularity, but it has since evolved to incorporate a wider range of styles.\n\nThe subculture carries a stereotype: young women who adopt this cute, hyperfeminine yet dark fashion are perceived to have personalities that contradict their appearance. Instead of being sweet and demure, they are often stereotyped as violent and obsessive (akin to a \nYandere\n), engaging in self-harm, and having habits of heavy drinking or smoking.\n\nJapanese brands have rapidly adapted to this trend, with Western brands influenced by Kawaii culture also following suit.\n\nContents\n\n1\n \nHistory\n\n2\n \nVisuals\n\n3\n \nFashion\n\n3.1\n \nTops\n\n3.2\n \nBottoms\n\n3.3\n \nShoes and Legwear\n\n3.4\n \nAccessories\n\n3.5\n \nHair and Makeup\n\n4\n \nMedia\n\n4.1\n \nLiterature\n\n4.2\n \nManga\n\n4.3\n \nTelevision\n\n4.4\n \nVideo Games\n\n5\n \nMusic\n\n5.1\n \nSongs\n\n5.2\n \nPlaylists\n\n6\n \nCriticism\n\n7\n \nResources\n\n7.1\n \nBlogs\n\n7.2\n \nVendors\n\n8\n \nGallery\n\n9\n \nReferences\n\n10\n \nNavigation\n\nHistory\n[\n]\n\nThe term \"Jirai Kei\" is derived from \"\nJirai Onna\n\" (地雷女), literally \"landmine woman,\" a derogatory term used to stereotype women, particularly those with mental illnesses such as Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), bipolar disorder, and other mood swing-inducing conditions, as a \"ticking time bomb.\" This term is often employed to dismiss women, frequently ex-girlfriends, as \"crazy\" or \"dangerous\" based on arbitrary traits, such as an affinity for kawaii aesthetics. Within the subculture, women are referred to as \"\nJirai Joshi\n\" (地雷女子), or \"landmine girls,\" while men are called \"\nJirai Danshi\n\" (地雷男子), or \"landmine boys.\"\n\nThe subculture became associated with various darker fashion styles following a \"psycho girlfriend\" dress-up challenge that gained viral traction during the March 2020 COVID-19 restrictions in Japan.\n[\n1\n]\n This challenge frequently referenced traits commonly associated with the Toyoko Kids, a group primarily composed of young runaway teenagers, some of whom were groomed online by older men with promises of a better life in the Kabukicho red-light district. These individuals are often exploited for sex work, drug trafficking, and other criminal activities.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\n\nWhile Western followers of Jirai Kei often attempt to separate it from its darker origins by viewing it solely as a fashion trend, the subculture largely retains a negative public image within Japan. Its associations with the \"psycho girlfriend\" trope are interpreted as a misogynistic stereotype, yet Japanese girls who identify as \"landmine\" fully embrace it.\n[\n4\n]\n This misunderstanding stems from several factors: the language barrier hindering accurate interpretation of Japanese articles and social media posts, a lack of awareness regarding the perception of mental health issues in Japan, and brands capitalizing on the subculture's popularity by using \"Jirai Kei\" as a marketing term, regardless of whether their products are genuinely associated with it.\n\nVisuals\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExample of a heavily edited selfie by @hiudayonn.\n \n \n\nGirls in this subculture add \nheavy filters and edits\n to their photos. Pale pink and white filters can add a slight haze to all of their images, and they are often decorated in \nvirtual stickers\n with Jirai Kei motifs. They also use \nface and body editing\n to the point of an unnatural appearance. Impossibly large eyes with anime proportions, making skin more pale, and making their bodies thinner and longer are extremely common in photos. This is with the goal of appearing eerie and puppy-eyed, diverging from the trend of \"pien\" makeup on Japanese tiktok. The color palettes of Jirai Kei is mainly white, black and pastel pink, though on occasion red, blue and grey is also used. \n\nTo contrast all of the sweet and girly visuals, violent imagery is often shown. \nBox-cutters, razors, and pockets knives\n are commonly featured in outfit posts. The stereotype is that a landmine girl would use it to threaten her boyfriend if he upsets her, or that she engages in self-harm. Additionally, these cute girls often pose with \nfake guns\n (firearms are illegal in Japan), cigarettes, or \nalcohol and energy drinks\n (from Strong Zero and Monster Energy) with straws, presumably to protect their lipstick while drinking. Many photos have color-scheme matching energy drink cans, and it is even popular to stack and glue the cans in the shape of machine guns. Similar to Yami Kawaii, there is often medical imagery of \npills and syringes\n, usually paired with narcotics and synthetic drugs. \n\nSanrio is strongly associated with the \nKawaii\n, girly, and consumer culture in Japan. As a result, girls into Jirai Kei are also associated with these characters, specifically \nKuromi\n and My Melody\n. People in this subculture own and take photos of plushies of these characters and own an assortment of merchandise, such as backpacks, pencil pouches, etc. themed around these characters. Sanrio has taken notice and even released Jirai Kei-inspired plushies of Kuromi and My Melody. Another character that can be associated is Menhera-chan, the suicidal magical girl that popularized \nYami Kawaii\n. Her artist has drawn her in stereotypical outfits, and her self-destructive habits could be relatable for those in the subculture. \n\nThere's also many artists engaging with the subculture who draw \nanime-style illustrations\n of landmine girls wearing the typical outfits while in stereotypical situations, such as taking selfies, holding a can while squatting on the streets, or having a mental breakdown. Jirai Kei followers often repost these \ndrawings on social media\n. \n\nFashion\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe various styles worn by jirai girls illustrated featuring Blue Archive characters. \n \n \n\nThe styles associated with Jirai Kei are constantly changing with the core defining trait being that the fashion is worn by landmine girls. Comparable to \nE-Girl\n’s style, while landmine girls may wear many different fashion styles, there is a main look typically associated with the aesthetic that evolved out of a mix of several different alternative genres. The initial look associated with the Jirai Kei subculture derived from \nJapanese Girly fashion\n and \nYami Kawaii\n, however outfits consisting out of \nGoth Punk\n, \nJersey Maid\n, and darker general \nalternative\n fashion have also been popular among its followers. As the trends within Jirai Kei keep on changing, many brands mimic one another and release mix-and-match variations for the various styles worn. The fabric of the clothes tends to be on the more synthetic side, with the quality not being that high, on account of them often being made by fast fashion companies who constantly adopt to the latest trends. \n\nRegardless of the style worn, the idea is to appear cute yet mature, but with an dark aura. \n\nThe ultra-feminine Jirai style has also evolved since its inception. As the style developed, the details of the style increased, with certain trends being more or less popular as certain garments from specific brands became viral. \n\nTops\n[\n]\n\nThe most common tops are \nblouses with ultra-feminine details\n that may slightly resemble \nLolita Fashion.\n Peter Pan and sailor collars, ruffles, lace trim, puffed sleeves, cold-shoulders, contrasting buttons are some tropes that are featured in the blouses. Alternative outfits use coat-dresses instead, and winter outfits utilize knit sweaters. Girls also often \ntie ribbons or add bow brooches with rhinestone or pearl-accented faux jewels\n at the neck. \n\nSome brands have also released \noversized tees and sweatshirts\n that can fit in with this aesthetic. They often have a print with a stereotypical motif, English text, anime prints, etc. These also contain feminine details, but less often. For example, there may be eyelets for lacing ribbon through, zippers, or detachable Peter Pan collars. This resembles the fashion of the \nYami Kawaii\n aesthetic, and contributes to an edgier and less girly look. Jirai boys add masculine or androgynous elements to this style, while girls like to pair these tops with chunky sneakers and necklaces. \n\nA trend that appeared approximately 2023 is the set-up, which is a two-piece set consisting of a \ntunic-length top with a matching pair of micro-shorts\n, with the aim of it looking like an extra-short dress, with the shorts being for modesty purposes. This top would have the same details as the blouses. \n\nBottoms\n[\n]\n\nHigh waisted mini skirts\n are by far the most popular bottom. The silhouette can be flared, trapezoid or pleated. \nSilver hardware details\n such as heart-shaped belt buckles, eyelets, and zippers add edge to the outfit and contrast the lace and girly details of the blouse. But there are also ruffles, ribbon lacing to resemble a corset, and ruffled suspenders to add girliness. \nShorts\n can also be featured in this aesthetic, as well as \nlonger flowy skirts\n. However, they are both comparatively rare to the mini skirts. Usually the bottoms are black while the top is pink or white, though sometimes this is flipped. \n\nThe more casual \nJersey Maid\n and \nYami Kawaii\n inspired looks can also have \ntrack pants\n like ones from Adidas as a pairing with a track suit jacket or oversized tee or sweatshirt. \n\nShoes and Legwear\n[\n]\n\nBecause the legs are most often exposed in this style, \nlace or fishnet stockings\n are worn, and could be switched or even doubled up with \nruffled or lace ankle socks\n. \n\nThe shoes are most commonly \nplatform loafers or multi-strapped mary janes\n, and most girls buy their shoes from BUBBLES Tokyo, DearMyLove, Liz Lisa and others. The shoes can be \nmore decorated,\n with faux jewels, ribbon laces, rhinestone buckles and silver cross charms. \n\nAccessories\n[\n]\n\nThe most popular bags are \ntotes and mini backpacks\n. Usually, they're pink or black, sometimes adorned with ribbons and bows with plushies or Sanrio figurine keychains attached. The most popular mini backpacks on social media are the studded MCM mini packpack and Melody Maison de Fleur totes. Other girls may instead use bags from \npopular luxury brands\n.\n\nAside from ribbons and bows, there is not much jewelry involved in Jirai Kei. Most styles include only earrings or neckwear like chokers, piercings and necklaces. A popular trend is the Viviene Westwood orb necklace. Because of the color scheme, many girls avoid gold jewelry and opt for silver.\n\nHair and Makeup\n[\n]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAn illustration of the typical hairstyles by \nAkagumi-chan\n.\n \n \n\nHime-cut bangs,\n which are straight bangs across the forehead with side bangs around chin-length, are extremely popular amongst young women in Japan in general as it is an easy way to archive the illusion of a small face. It fits in with the ultra-feminine style. Because these women are Japanese and around high school age, the \nmost common hair color is black\n, since dyed hair is not allowed in schools. However, some girls add \nhighlights that can be bleached blonde or in different shades of pink.\n\nIn terms of styling, \npigtails\n (also called twin tails), are the majority hairstyle. They can be either low or high, with high pigtails often being \nhalf-up half-down\n. Girls often curl the ends and decorate these twin tails with \nribbons and bows\n, often with the same faux jewels on their brooches. Other \nhair accessories\n such as rectangle headdresses, headbands with faux jewels, and bobby pins with charms are popular too. \n\nFor the eye makeup, the most popular is an exaggerated version of the \"\nnamida bukuro\n\" makeup style where the \ntear bags\n are emphasized to look puffy as if the wearer is about to cry, which is further highlighted with pink undereye blush. The additional effect of appearing sickly is also desired. The \neyeliner is downturned to give a more \"puppy-like\"\n , feminine and sad appearance. \n\nFace and lip makeup are equally pink, with \nblush and sparkly highlighter being high\n on the cheekbones. \nLip makeup has a wide variation\n, with some looks being more matte, some glossy, some sculpted, some even. \n\nMany additional cosmetic products are also used for exaggerated features. \nFake lashes\n are generally popular in Japan, and in Jirai Kei, they are longer and spikier. \nDark circle lenses\n are also popular, and serve to make the eyes look bigger and anime-like. \n\nLong acrylic nails\n are also popular and often feature lace patterns, faux jewels, corset lacing, crosses, as well as stereotypical motifs like the pleading face emoji. \n\nMedia\n[\n]\n\nLiterature\n[\n]\n\nHost Madness\n - Oizumi Rika\n\nKabukicho Moratorium\n - Chiwawa Sasaki\n\nPeople Who Overdose\n - Chiwawa Sasaki\n\nThe Disease of Pien: Consumption and Approval of the SNS Generation\n - Chiwawa Sasaki\n\nManga\n[\n]\n\nAshita, Watashi wa Dareka no Kanojo - Tomorrow, I'll Be Someone's Girlfriend\n\nAndroid wa Jirai-kei no Yume wo Miru - Android Dreams of a Jirai Kei Girl\n\nKiken na Ren'ai - Dangerous Love\n\nKimi ni Aisarete Itakatta - It Hurts To Be Loved By You\n\nJirai Kareshi - My Boyfriend's a Ticking Time Bomb\n\nJirai-kei JK to Onee-chan no Hanashi - The Landmine Girl and Her Sister\n\nJirai Ninja Ruru no Shitsuren - Jirai Ninja Ruru's Heartbreak\n\nKakaKano - Dating the Kind of Girl You Shouldn't Get Involved With\n\nKoi wa Jirai wo Funde kara - A Love That Begins After Stepping On A Mine\n\nMitame Jirai-kei Osananajimi - My Childhood Friend Looks Like A Landmine But Isn't\n\nYamaarashi no Shisha (ヤマアラシのシーシャ)\n\nZenma (銭麻)\n\nTelevision\n[\n]\n\nAshita, Watashi wa Dareka no Kanojo\n\nCinderella Complex\n\nIshiko and Haneo: You're Suing Me?\n (episode 7)\n\nThe Black Swindler (episode 8)\n\nVideo Games\n[\n]\n\nJIRAIYA\n\nNeedy Streamer Overload\n\nSentimental Deathloop\n\nSuteki na Kanojo no Tsukurikata\n\nYandere ura Kano Jirai-chan\n\nYamikore\n\nLove Angel Syndrome\n\nMusic\n[\n]\n\nSongs\n[\n]\n\nAlice*Iris - Daikirai Lie Suki\n\nAlice*Iris - Gimme Me Love\n\nAmu - Pien Syndrome\n\nAmu - Mekka Warning\n\nCagayake - Unleash\n\nChilldspot - Ai Ai\n\nDECO*27 - The Vampire\n\nIsana - Menhera Janai Mon!\n\nHoneyWorks - Kawaikute Gomen\n\nKuraisekai - So Pien My Life\n\nKAFU - Egonomy\n\nKai - Unicorn Girl\n\nKai - Lose the Princess\n\nKairiki Bear - Darling Dance\n\nKareki Kashiwagi - Ikayaki-Wristed Girl\n\nLiLiPi - Shukipi Overdose\n\nMagnetite Hiiragi feat.

There are strong associations with mental illness, self harm, drug usage, sex work, underage prostitution, and other uncomfortable subjects. The negative aspects of the \"landmine\" stereotype are often emulated and romanticized as a quirky gimmick solely for aesthetic reasons.\n[\n5\n]\n On Twitter in particular, it's not uncommon for followers of the subculture to constantly promote self-destructive behaviour, the accounts often being part of \nshtwt\n (self-harm twitter) and \nedtwt\n (eating disorder twitter).\n[\n4\n]\n There's also a strong association with \"bangya\" culture with landmine girls also being stereotyped as groupies who are obsessive over their favorite bands and music artists to an unhealthy degree.\n\nAnother problem is the fetishization of the \"landmine\" stereotype, which is a glimpse into the wider topic of sexualizing women who exhibit mental illness. It is problematic for its ableist rhetoric claiming mentally-ill women to be \"freaky\", \"hot but crazy\" and more desirable sexually and emotionally, as well as its infantalistic undertone of these women being more emotionally attached and dependent on their lover's affection.\n[\n6\n]\n This fetishization of mentally ill women and use of the femme-fatale archetype ignores the unpleasant nuances of suffering from BPD or bipolar disorder and targets women who are mentally vulnerable to emotionally abusive, power-imbalanced relationships.\n[\n7\n]\n\nThere also have been issues caused by the strong associations with the host culture of Kabukicho. As people of any age can enter those establishments as long as no alcohol is served, male hosts have been actively going for young girls to spend money on them in exchange for affection, often resulting in the girls resorting to \"papa katsu\" (sugar-daddying) in order to afford their host club addiction.\n[\n8\n]\n\nBecause the clothes worn are often very brand specific, some Jirai Kei netizens suggest that there is slight elitism in the community for purchasing items from the \"correct\" stores, regardless of if the price can be prohibitively expensive, particularly for western followers that endure high shipping fees from Japanese brand proxies. On social media, especially on TikTok, some argue that this brand-focused side of Jirai Kei encourages hyper consumerism and trend-cycling while the same is also said for those who buy cheap replica items from problematic fast fashion stores like Shein/Romwe. \n\nAs the subculture can't be separated from its problematic parts precisely because they are what make Jirai Kei what it is, many have argued that its name shouldn't be used in a throwaway manner in reference to styles or trends in order to not expose strangers to potential triggering content. \n\nResources\n[\n]\n\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\nFor further reading, please read its \npage\n on the Jfashion Wiki. \n\nBlogs\n[\n]\n\nZirai Bijyo\n\nSubcul Zirai\n\nZirai Zyoshi\n\nVendors\n[\n]\n\nAnk Rouge\n\nAmilige\n\nBubbles\n\nDarrdy\n\nDearMyLove\n\nLafary\n\nLIZ LISA\n\nMA*RS\n\nNoemie\n\nReflem\n\nRojita\n\nSubcul Zirai\n\nTravas Tokyo\n\nViviene Westwood\n\nYosuke USA\n\nGallery\n[\n]\n\nキャンメイク縛り地雷メイク【イエベ・茶髪OK】\nA makeup tutorial\n\nReferences\n[\n]\n\n↑\n \nAbsolutely the largest eyes!!

However, with changes in times and discourse environments, the meaning of the term has evolved based on social realities, developing different nuances. The term itself has also expanded its reach with the advancement of communication technologies, particularly forming a new youth subculture phenomenon in China. This article separately outlines the developmental history of \"Jirai Onna\" in both China and Japan, and provides a distinct summary of the developing history of \"Jirai Onna\" in both China and Japan. Finally, it provides a potential analysis of the factors that contribute to the disparities in the Landmine Girl culture that exist between China and Japan. The expectation is that this will be of use to researchers in the future who are investigating different young subculture organizations.\n\nKeywords: \n\nCultural Differences, Jirai Onna, Subculture\n\n Download PDF\n \n\n View PDF\n\nSun,R.

Social Networking Services (SNS), with their User-Generated Content (UGC) production model, have broken the monopoly of professionals over discourse power, promoting spontaneous communication among ordinary users and fostering a space for the flourishing of niche subcultures.\n\nAs East Asian countries, China and Japan share similar cultural foundations. The languages they use have commonalities in meaning, and their social atmospheres are also more alike. This provides a natural foundation for grassroots cultural exchanges. However, similar to other communication activities, subcultures inevitably present a more localized appearance in the final decoding stage of their dissemination process.\n\nThis paper selects the \"Jirai Kei\" (地雷系) culture originating from Japan, as an example, tracing its history and development in both China and Japan.\" It is more effective to discuss subcultures on the basis of discussing society. The analysis of fictional worlds is closely related to the understanding of the real world \"[1].\n\nMost previous research has focused on the dissemination process of subcultures or the psychological challenges faced by subcultural groups [2][3][4]. Few studies have conducted detailed comparisons of a specific subculture between two countries and explored the communication activities involved.\n\nThis paper aims to provide a reference case for future cross-cultural research and to enhance the objective understanding of the \"Jirai Kei\" culture group by the outside world.\n\n2.\n Main discussion \n\n2.1.\n The history of Jirai Kei culture in Japan \n\nThe origins of Jirai Kei culture can be traced back to the term \"Jirai Onna\" (地雷女), a popular internet catchphrase used around 2010 on the Japanese anonymous forum 2 channel (2ちゃんねる). This term was used to describe women who appeared cute on the surface but had serious issues in intimate relationships. Due to their seemingly harmless exterior hiding a potentially destructive nature—similar to a \"ticking time bomb\"—they were labeled as \"Jirai Onna\" or \"landmine women.\" When used to describe others, the term carries a derogatory connotation, often implying that the person suffers from mental illness. \n\nOther similar catchphrases include \"Pien-kei\" (ぴえん系) and \"Menhera\" (ﾒﾝﾍﾗ). \"Pien-kei\" is widely believed to have emerged around 2018 in the Kabukicho (歌舞伎町) area, named after the popular EMOJI \"Pleading Face\" (ぴえん) frequently used by Japanese youth. The rise of Pien-kei girls is closely tied to Kabukicho's host club industry. Sasaki Chiwawa [5] argues that \"Pien-kei girls essentially desire to be cute, but not everyone can achieve the 'mainstream' cuteness of actresses or models on TV. As a result, they gather in Kabukicho, where spending money can earn them compliments on their cuteness, and they fulfill their desires by spending on hosts.\" Through this behavior, which differs from traditional romantic relationships and is referred to as \"oshi\" (推し), they find meaning in their lives [6]. \n\nThe word \"Menhera\" emerged around the same time as \"Jirai Onna.\" It is a Japanese internet adaptation of the English term \"mental health\" and first appeared in the mental health section of 2channel. This term is most frequently used in Japanese research on Jirai Kei culture and is often associated with mental illnesses such as borderline personality disorder [7].\n\nGoogle search data also shows that \"Jirai Onna\" and \"Menhera\" had similar search frequencies during the same period, while the search curve for \"Pien-kei\" clearly reflects the characteristics of a new catchphrase emerging around 2020.\n\nFigure 1: Global search popularity of \"Jirai Onna\" (Blue Line), \"Menhera\" (Green Line), and \"Pien-kei\" (Red Line) from January 2004 to February 13, 2025\n\nAlthough the three catchphrases—\"Jirai Onna,\" \"Menhera,\" and \"Pien-kei\"—differ in their etymology, origins, and time of emergence, they share similar meanings. All are used to describe individuals (primarily women) who appear delicate and pitiable on the surface but are emotionally unstable or mentally troubled. We collectively refer to these three catchphrases as \"Jirai Kei\" in the following sections.\n\n2.2.\n The current state of Jirai Kei in Japan \n\n2.2.1.\n Jirai Kei as a standalone fashion culture \n\nIn contemporary Japan, Jirai Kei has evolved beyond its original catchphrase to become a distinct fashion subculture. This transformation reflects the complex interplay between online identity and real-world expression of young people.\n\nJirai Kei is characterized by its mix of cuteness and darkness, often incorporating elements such as pastel colors, frilly dresses, and childlike accessories alongside darker motifs like crosses, bandages, and gothic-inspired details. This aesthetic serves as a visual metaphor for the inner turmoil and emotional instability associated with the Jirai Kei identity. \n\nThe rise of Jirai Kei as a fashion trend can be attributed to its resonance with individuals who feel marginalized or misunderstood by mainstream society. By adopting this style, they express their struggles with mental health, relationships, and societal pressures in a way that is both personal and communal. Social media platforms, particularly Instagram and Twitter, have played a significant role in popularizing Jirai Kei fashion, allowing individuals to share their outfits, connect with like-minded people, and build a sense of belonging. Jirai Kei as a youth subculture reflect the values of youths today and resist elements of society in a visually stimulating way [8].\n\nHowever, the commercialization of Jirai Kei fashion had sparked debates. Some critics argue that the subculture's origins in mental health struggles and emotional vulnerability are being diluted as it becomes more mainstream.\n\n2.2.2.\n To-yoko kids(ﾄｰ横ｷｯｽﾞ) with Jirai Kei\n\nNext to the Toho Building in Kabukicho, there are often many young people gathered alone, wandering outside. Most of them are between 12 and 19 years old, having chosen to run away from home due to conflicts with their parents. Their numbers are so large that it has become a social phenomenon, and they are referred to by a specific term: \"To-yoko kids\" (ﾄｰ横ｷｯｽﾞ). \n\nMany of these To-yoko kids are minors who have not completed their education and lack the skills to make a living, making it difficult for them to participate in regular work. To cover daily expenses, many young women turn to \"sugar dating\" (ﾊﾟﾊﾟ活 ) relationships to earn money. Some girls choose to wear \"Jirai Kei\" fashion. This cute style not only enhances their physical attractiveness but also helps them quickly become the part of To-yoko kids community.\n\nMany people living here have no time to plan for the future, and they can only drift through the red-light district. The culture of the red-light district subtly influences their habits. Many To-yoko kids have unhealthy practices such as drug overdose, self-harm, and prostitution [9]. These behaviors serve as desperate ways for them to cope with the harsh realities they face.\n\nIt can be said that the To-yoko kids are the group that most closely aligns with the original definition of \"Jirai Onna\" today, and their expressions of it have become even more extreme. This phenomenon reflects structural deficiencies in Japanese society regarding youth protection and educational support.\n\n2.3.\n The development of Jirai Kei culture in China \n\nThe introduction of \"Jirai Kei\" to China occurred later than its emergence in Japan. Initially, it spread through anime and music, becoming integrated with otaku culture. In the early Chinese internet context, \"Jirai Kei\" did not carry a negative connotation but was instead seen as a \"cute\" associated with anime characters. The dangerous and emotionally unstable aspects of \"Jirai Onna\" were downplayed, transforming the image into one of a cute, well-dressed girl.\n\n A cute example is \"Menherachan\", a character who gained popularity on Bilibili in 2018. Another example closer to the original meaning of \"Jirai Onna\" is the VOCALOID song \"Venom\" (ﾍﾞﾉﾑ), released the same year. These two distinct perceptions of Jirai Kei culture became recognized as part of “otaku culture” in China, though they had not yet fully entered the mainstream internet lexicon. \n\nThe turning point for the development of \"Jirai Kei\" in China came after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019. Compared to the past, the pandemic lockdowns brought greater mental stress, forcing the younger generation to spend more time online.\n\nIn 2022, the release of the game “NEEDY GIRL OVERDOSE” further propelled the spread of the \"Jirai Onna\" label in China, as the game's protagonist embodied the typical appearance and mental state of a \"Jirai Onna.\" To cope with the pressures of daily life and seek emotional satisfaction and freedom, netizens began to freely create symbols and mock any form of rigidity [10][11]. Despite knowing that \"Jirai Onna\" originally carried a derogatory meaning, many people adopted self-deprecating humor to embrace and role-play as \"Jirai Onna,\" using it as a way to accept their unchangeable reality and gain a sense of belonging online [12], forming new interest-based communities. In China, these communities are primarily rooted in social platforms with a majority female user base, such as Redbook and Weibo. \n\n2.4.\n Similarities and differences between Chinese and Japanese Jirai Kei culture \n\nJapan's \"Jirai Kei\" culture started as a way to categorize real-life individuals or groups, reflecting societal realities. Essentially, it evolved from offline to online but never fully detached from its red-light district roots. This connection means the culture not only emerged from the red-light district but also draws those who identify as \"Jirai Onna\" or \"Jirai Otoko\" back into that environment.\n\nIn China, \"Jirai Kei\" culture began online and has since taken root in major social media platforms, forming virtual communities without physical gathering spaces. Unlike in Japan, Chinese enthusiasts focus less on internal struggles and more on their social media appearance, striving to match the standard Japanese \"Jirai Onna\" aesthetic. In anonymous forums, criticism often targets photos for having a \"China style\" (中味), citing issues like body shape, light makeup, or skin tone that deviate from the traditional \"Jirai Onna\" look. A brand hierarchy has also emerged, with Japanese labels favored over local ones, despite their higher cost.\n\nWhile Japanese \"Jirai Onna\" culture initially aimed to attract male attention and build relationships, its Chinese counterpart has blended with radical feminist ideas. Many Chinese \"Jirai Onna\" reject men entirely, criticizing them solely for their gender, even if they show interest in the culture. As a result, men are often excluded from participating or speaking in these communities.\n\n3.\n Conclusion\n\nDespite the many differences between Chinese and Japanese Jirai Kei cultures, there is one key similarity: just as Jirai Kei culture is gaining popularity in China, its prominence in Japan has also been rising in recent years. The resurgence of Jirai Kei culture symbolizes a shared societal pressure in both countries—unhappy family environments and overly competitive, \"involutionary\" social systems have forced young people, who feel unable to participate in this competition, to choose a path of rebellion. Through social media, ordinary people are exposed to a broader world and more possibilities, but the stark contrast between the idealized hologram of happiness online and the harsh realities of life creates a sense of helpless disconnection. Identifying with pre-modern subcultures may be a way to seek security and escape reality.\n\nWe need more unbiased understanding to clarify the root causes of these phenomena. It is hoped that future research will provide opportunities to delve deeper into the lives of Jirai Kei communities in both China and Japan, exploring how cultural dissemination operates and how geographical, economic, and political factors have shaped the same external culture into different core identities.\n\nReferences\n\n[1].

Among the most conspicuous is the emergence of \nmenhera\n (a portmanteau of “mental health-er”) girls, female characters who exhibit unstable emotionality, obsessive love, and stereotypical self-injurious behaviors such as wrist cutting. Tracing the expansion of this popular cultural slang since 2000, this conceptual article explores three narrative tropes of \nmenhera\n—the sad girl, the mad woman, and the cutie. Within these \nmenhera\n narratives, self-injury functions as a self-sufficient signifier of female vulnerability, monstrosity, and desire for agency. These \nmenhera\n tropes, each with their unique interpretation of self-injury, have evolved symbiotically with traditional gender norms in Japan, while destabilizing long-standing undesirability of sick/detracted female bodies. The \nmenhera\n narrative tropes mobilize cultural discourses about female madness and subsequently feed back into the social imaginaries, offering those who self-injure symbolic resources for self-interpretation. We argue that popular cultural narratives of self-injury like \nmenhera\n may exert as powerful an influence as clinical discourses on the way we interpret, make sense of, and experience self-injury. Being attentive to cultural representations of self-injury thus can help clinicians move toward compassionate clinical practice beyond the medical paradigm.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSelf-injury, intentional damaging of one's body without a clear suicidal intent, is an enigmatic behavior that breaches boundaries between sanity and madness, physical and mental health (\nChandler, 2014\n). Images of self-injury now surround us, along with voluminous narratives of mental ill-health\n1\n in popular media. Studies have documented the growing number of self-injury portrayals across popular media including films (\nChouinard, 2009\n; \nTrewavas et al., 2010\n; \nDanylevich, 2016\n; \nBareiss, 2017\n), TV shows (\nWhitlock et al., 2009\n), young adult fiction (\nMiskec and McGee, 2007\n) and comics (\nSeko and Kikuchi, 2020\n). Alongside mass media, interactive and visual-rich social media platforms have enabled instant sharing of user-generated self-injury content at an unprecedented speed and scale (\nSeko, 2013\n; \nSeko and Lewis, 2016\n; \nAlderton, 2018\n).\n\nWhile self-injury, with its enhanced visibility, touches many people's lives, the perceived meanings ascribed to this practice vary widely. Research on media portrayals of self-injury has revealed a range of implicit and explicit meanings attached to this practice, including emotional regulation, self-punishment, coping mechanism, interpersonal manipulation, self-affirmation, or resistance to oppression (\nDanylevich, 2016\n; \nBareiss, 2017\n; \nSeko and Kikuchi, 2020\n). Although what self-injury \nmeans\n to the person varies across media narratives, there is a recognizable pattern in \nwho\n engages in this practice. Studies indicate that self-injuring characters in popular media are predominantly female adolescents who self-cut (\nWhitlock et al., 2009\n; \nTrewavas et al., 2010\n; \nRadovic and Hasking, 2013\n). This portrayal reflects and reproduces the medical discourse that has historically associated self-injury with young women and an act of cutting (\nBrickman, 2004\n; \nMillard, 2013\n).\n\nA body of critical sociological research illuminates the long-standing association between self-injury and femininity in clinical literature in which female mental fragility and irrationality is contrasted to the aggressive and violent male pathology (e.g., \nMillard, 2013\n). Statistical “facts” have cemented this “gendered paradox” in suicide (\nCanetto and Sakinofsky, 1998\n), namely, women have higher rates of suicidal ideation and non-fatal suicidal behaviors, whereas suicide mortality is higher for men than women. In modern psychiatry, female self-cutting has thus been framed as a “delicate,” non-fatal self-injury (\nBrickman, 2004\n) that resonated closely with gendered cultural norms on how women should act with and through their bodies. \nChandler and Simopoulou (2021)\n, in their arts-based participatory study, contend that self-inflicted injuries on a female body are often read differently than the same injuries on a male body. Violence acted by women on their bodies elicits “shock, disbelief, disgust,” thereby leading to immediate pathologization (p. 8).\n\nTo date, published research in English on media representations of self-injury has focused almost exclusively on the Anglophone content, paying little attention to non-Anglophone portrayals of self-injury and the role popular media may play in shaping cultural understanding of this practice. However, self-injury has been explicitly thematized in Japanese popular culture over the last few decades. In a previous study, we conducted an extensive search of slice-of-life\n2\n \nmanga\n (graphic novels) published between 2000 and 2017 portraying self-injury in everyday life context (\nSeko and Kikuchi, 2020\n). Across 15 \nmanga\n we examined, the characters engaging in self-injury were predominantly young women cutting themselves to cope with feelings of despair, loneliness, or emotional numbness, replicating research on Anglophone media. However, there were two contrasting perspectives toward young girls who self-injure. On one hand, in \nmanga\n targeting young girls (\nshōjo manga\n), characters engaging in self-injury were primarily protagonists of the narrative who choose self-injury as a maladaptive coping strategy against external pressures (e.g., bullying, oppressive parents). On the other hand, \nmanga\n targeting adult male readers (\nseinen manga\n) portrayed women who self-injure as mentally vulnerable, attractive, and helpless mistresses waiting to be rescued by male protagonists. Notably, many of those female characters in \nseinen manga\n were called \nmenhera\n (a portmanteau of “\nmen\ntal \nheal\nth-\ner\n”) that exhibited unstable emotionality, impulsivity, and sexual promiscuity, along with stereotypical self-injurious behaviors, most often recurrent wrist cutting without a clear suicidal intent (\nSeko and Kikuchi, 2020\n).\n\nIt was around 2014 that we became aware of \nmenhera\n's growing visibility in the Japanese popular cultural landscape, not only in \nmanga\n, but also across \nanime\n (animation) video games, fashion, and character merchandise. Building on our previous study (\nSeko and Kikuchi, 2020\n) and our continuous observation of Japanese popular culture over the past decade, this article provides an initial thought on the emergence of \nmenhera\n narrative tropes, focusing on how self-injury is constructed, appropriated, and repurposed as a metonymy of female madness. We offer a typology of \nmenhera\n by describing the three prevailing narrative tropes: the sad girl who adapts the \nmenhera\n label to self-pathologize their mental angst, the mad woman who exhibits pathetic obsession over her love interest, and the cutie who playfully performs subcultural “sick-cute” aesthetic through fashion. As we will be discussing, these narrative tropes are not mutually exclusive nor occurring discretely; instead, they often converge and inflect one another within one single character and across diverse popular cultural products. We contend that these \nmenhera\n tropes, each with their unique interpretation of self-injury, have evolved symbiotically with the long-standing gender norms in Japan, weaving a complex net of meanings within which female madness is pathologized, fetishized, and performed.\n\nAlthough this article focuses on a Japanese cultural slang as a case in point, our aim is not to ignite an Orientalist discourse around Japanese culture as exotic or peculiar. Rather, given that Japanese \nmanga, anime\n, games, fashion and other popular cultural texts and artifacts have now reached far beyond Japan and exercise significant influences on the cultural landscapes of Asia, North America, and Europe, we aim to ponder on representations of self-injury in popular culture and extrapolate their potential clinical and research implications. In so doing, this article aims to join the growing critical discussion on popular culture's contribution to “pathologization from below” (\nBrinkmann, 2014\n), a process in which popular culture provides a set of semiotic and material practices that shape people's interpretations, feelings, and experiences of mental ill-health. We argue that popular cultural narratives of self-injury like \nmenhera\n may exert as powerful an influence as clinical discourses on the way we interpret, make sense of, and engage with self-injury.\n\nTypology of \nmenhera\n\nThe Origin\n\nThe slang \nmenhera\n was reportedly spawned on the \nmentaru herusu ban\n (mental health board)\n3\n, one of the anonymous discussion boards at a massive online community \n2-channel\n4\n. The mental health board facilitated discussions featuring a wide range of mental health issues including depression, mania, mood disorders, and trauma, among others. Regular users of the discussion board exchanged information about medications, therapies, or local healthcare providers, vented their pent-up feelings, and shared emotional support through anonymous postings. In October 2016, 090, a columnist for an online support network \nmenhera.jp\n, conducted extensive archival research on \n2-channel\n to trace the origin of the term \nmenhera\n. The earliest use of the term dated back to August 2000 when the regulars of the board started describing their community as \nmenheru ban\n, using an abbreviation of \nmentaru herusu\n (mental health) (\n090, 2016a\n). The abbreviation quickly spread among the board members who started calling themselves “\nmenhera\n” (\nmen\ntal \nhealth\n-\ner\n) with the suffix “-er” to indicate their membership to the board. The initial use of the term “\nmenhera\n” thus referred to the board members who self-identified themselves as living with some form of mental ill-health regardless of their diagnosis, gender, and age.\n\nSince the onset of the mental health board, the topic of self-injury has been discussed sporadically among the members. Our observation of the oldest 6,907 threads on the \n2-channel\n mental health board (between November 1999 and July 2001)\n5\n suggests that there were at least 40 threads featuring the topic of self-injury, with the most prominent topic being \nrisuka\n (wrist cutting). The messages posted on these threads entailed a complex set of cutting-related disclosures and advice: some turned to the board to report that they had just self-injured, while others asked for tips to hide scars. Some looked for advice on how to suppress the urge to cut, how to cut safely, or how to support significant others engaging in self-cutting. Notably, none of the 3,792 posts to the 40 threads featuring self-injury included the term \nmenhera\n, which indicates that the link between self-injury and \nmenhera\n was not explicitly established at the dawn of this online slang.\n\nLater, the term \nmenhera\n extended from the mental health board to the broader \n2-channel\n community. According to \n090\n (\n2016a\n), users of other \n2-channel\n boards began using the term around 2003 to refer to the regulars of the mental health board or persons living with mental ill-health in general. By 2005, the term appeared on one of the most popular boards \nnyūsoku VIP ban\n (newsflash VIP board)—notorious for vibrant discussions filled with insider jokes, slander, hate speech, and misogynist remarks. It was likely on the \nnyūsoku VIP ban\n when the term \nmenhera\n was first explicitly linked to women in a pejorative manner. \n090\n (\n2016b\n) identified the emergence of a term \nmenhera onna\n (\nmenhera\n woman) on the \nnyūsoku VIP ban\n which disparagingly referred to women who engage in “pathetic” acts such as extreme mood swings, risky sexual behaviors, and self-injurious acts. One potential reason for this pejorative and gendered connotation was the perceived equation of \nmenhera\n with persons living with borderline personality disorder (BPD) \n090\n (\n2016b\n). BPD is predominantly diagnosed in females (\nGrant et al., 2008\n) and is highly stigmatized within medical communities as “manipulative,” “demanding,” and “attention seeking” (\nAviram et al., 2006\n). By 2008, the term came to derogatively refer to women with “BPD-like” behaviors as troublesome attention seekers from whom “normal” people should keep their distance \n090\n (\n2016b\n).\n\nWith the rapid growth of the Japanese digital landscape, the term \nmenhera\n and its gendered connotation has expanded from the \n2-channel\n subculture to a wider sea of the internet and merged into the mainstream popular culture\n6\n. In May 2021, we searched the term “\nmenhera\n” in three digital databases for Japanese \nmanga, anime\n, and games: the Japan National Diet Library's online catalog (\nhttp://www.ndl.go.jp/\n), the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs' media arts digital archive (\nhttps://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp\n), and Kyoto International Manga Museum's Manga Repository (\nhttp://mmsearch.kyotomm.jp/index_j.html\n). We also searched the term on the App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store (Android) to identify potential gaming apps and visited several online communities featuring Japanese popular culture including 5-channel. Our search identified 27 unique books (14 \nmanga\n, 7 novels, 6 non-fictions) and 5 gaming apps with the term “\nmenhera\n” in their titles, all of which were published in or after 2012. This echoes the study by \nTerada and Watanabe (2021)\n who assessed public interest in \nmenhera\n using Google Trends to evaluate how frequently the term was queried on Google's search engine. They identified that the number of searches rose significantly during 2010-2011 and continued steadily increasing until the time of their writing (January 2021). Despite the fast-paced changes on the internet, this slang has stuck around for a decade and become part of everyday lexicon in Japan, generating three narrative tropes to which we now turn.\n\nThe Sad Girl\n\nThe first \nmenhera\n narrative trope is the sad girl\n7\n, a young woman who struggles with feelings of anxiety, low self-esteem, hopelessness, and loneliness. This narrative focuses on the inner turmoil of girls living with mental angst expressed through a first-person narration of some kind. The sad girl narrative itself pre-dates \nmenhera\n. Since the 1990's, when the Japanese economy suffered a prolonged recession, narratives of psychosocial angst have manifested widely in Japanese popular culture. The term \nikizurasa\n (pain of living) has been used to denote anxiety experienced by many Japanese Millennials struggling with a sense of disconnectedness and self-blaming (\nNae, 2018\n), caused by a vast array of issues from unemployment, poverty, family problems to bullying, social withdrawal and mental ill-health (\nKido, 2016\n). The internet, with its relative anonymity, has provided a haven for people living with life struggles, including those who engage with self-injury. The advancement of user-friendly social media platforms has further provided a fertile ground for \nikizurasa\n monologs to grow and multiply.\n\nThe term \nmenhera\n, with its association with femininity, has a considerable appeal to young women struggling with \nikizurasa. One\n of the earliest examples is an indie \nmanga\n titled \nMenhera-chan\n written by then 14-year-old Kotoha Toko\n8\n who started posting an autobiographical \nmanga\n on her personal website around 2010. With the support from a professional editor who discovered her website, Kotoha published the \nmanga\n in two-volume book format (\nKotoha, 2012\n). In this coming-of-age \nmanga\n, the female protagonist \nMenhera-chan\n (“the \nmenhera\n girl”) is a junior high school student experiencing long-term school refusal and social withdrawal due to undiagnosed depression. Two other main characters, \nKenkou-kun\n (“the healthy boy”) and \nByoujaku-chan\n (“the frail girl”), become friends with \nMenhera-chan\n and offer her emotional support and encouragement. Although \nMenhera-chan\n does not engage in self-injury, there are repeated references to suicide by overdose and self-strangulation that provides a strong link between \nmenhera\n and self-destructive acts.\n\nWhen asked why she wrote \nMenhera-chan\n, Kotoha commented in an interview:\n\n“When I looked around myself, I realized that there were quite a few people who easily cry or feel hurt. People who live normally may wonder about these people like ‘Why do you cry over such a small thing?' or tell them ‘Don't feel hurt by such a thing!' But even those who think they have nothing to do with ‘\nmenhera\n' never know who would become the one, and indeed some people may step in the realm before they know it. This is why I wrote \nMenhera-chan\n with the hope that readers would think ‘Ah, I can relate' or ‘I can understand \nMenhera-chan\n's feelings”' (\nDa Vinci News, 2013\n).\n\nFor Kotoha who has personally experienced bullying and social withdrawal, \nmenhera\n is a liminal state of being that anyone can “step in” at any time. This subtle normalization proposes an antithesis to the prevailing marginalization of social misfits who, due to various reasons, deviate from the mainstream Japanese career and life path of getting a stable job, having a family, and becoming a responsible citizen (\nNae, 2018\n). Nevertheless, by naming the protagonist \nMenhera-chan\n, the author explicitly pathologized the prevailing \nikizurasa\n among young women. \nMenhera\n girls “easily cry or feel hurt” because of their morbid individual pathology, which should be frowned upon and discouraged by “people who live normally.” It is also noteworthy that this \nmanga\n ends with the protagonist overcoming her long-term school refusal and attending a part-time high school. By describing the protagonist's gradual return to the normative social trajectory, \nKotoha (2012)\n frames the mentally unhealthy girlhood as part of the passage to adulthood—which can be managed with time and optimal support from significant others.\n\nAnother notable sad girl narrative comes from a series of graphic narratives posted on Twitter by a young illustrator Momose Asami under the username @\nmenherashoujo\n (\nmenhera\n girl). Since 2013 Momose has tweeted one illustration a day, featuring a mouthless girl in a sailor suit (school uniform). Unlike \nKotoha (2012)\n \nmanga\n which is drawn in a comic strip format, Momose's work is a single panel comic that depicts a girl suffering loneliness, sadness, and despair. Most images are accompanied with a few spoken lines of the \nmenhera\n girl's monolog or a short dialogue between her and anonymous others who seemingly do not understand what the girl is struggling with. Although it is not described whether the \nmenhera\n girl has a diagnosable mental disorder or what is causing her angst, self-injury (wrist cutting) is depicted as a way for the \nmenhera\n girl to cope with inner pain or to manage a dissociative feeling to make sure she is still alive (\nFigure 1\n). As of May 2021, Momose's Twitter account has over 85,000 followers and the collection of her illustrations was published in a book titled “The Voice of a Gray Girl” (\nMomose, 2016\n).\n\nFIGURE 1\n\n \n\nFigure 1\n. “Doesn't wrist-cutting hurt?” “It doesn't hurt (as much as my heart).” A graphic narrative posted on Twitter by Momose Asami (@menherashoujo). Image reproduced with permission from the author.\n\nThese sad girl narratives indicate that the slang provided the creators with a relatively neutral and all-encompassing label to portray contemporary Japanese girls struggling with the pain of living. It deserves attention that the sad girl \nmenhera\n embodies stereotypical Japanese femininity, such as submissiveness, self-control, and free of selfishness. \nMomose (2016)\n mouthless character eloquently suggests that the \nmenhera\n girl suffers in silence; everything we see and hear about her is through her inner monolog filled with despair and distress, but she has no voice to raise. Self-injury is depicted as a means to externalize and cope with her inner pain, rather than communicating her angst to others. Momose's depiction of the \nmenhera\n girl as a “gray girl” is particularly telling in this regard. In her study on media portrayals of eating disorders and self-harm among Japanese women, \nHansen (2011)\n asserts that women in contemporary Japan often face “the paradox of navigating contradictive femininity in a gray zone between the normal and the disordered” (p. 57). To be “the good and clean girl” requires Japanese women to exercise rigid self-control over their bodies to “suppress the evil” in themselves (\nHansen, 2011\n, p. 61). In the sad girl narratives, self-harming actions such as self-induced regurgitation, starvation, and self-cutting are portrayed as a borderline disordered act performed by young women attempting to navigate the contradictive femininity.\n\nParadoxically, the link between \nmenhera\n and stereotypical femininity has resulted in \nmenhera\n's sudden upsurge in popularity, particularly within \nmanga/anime\n targeting male audiences. For example, \nLast Menhera\n (\nAmano and Ise, 2016\n) is a \nseinen manga\n (young male comic) that follows a high school boy falling in love with a beautiful classmate who self-cuts (\nFigure 2\n). Throughout the story, the heroine engages in recurring wrist slashing to “endure the pain of living” and “postpone the decision [to commit suicide]” (\nAmano and Ise, 2016\n, p. 56) which leads other characters to label her \nmenhera\n. The male protagonist pretends that he, too, self-injures to attract her attention and affection. Through the protagonist's male gaze, the heroine's scarred body becomes the object of affective consumption wherein self-injury symbolizes her vulnerability, helplessness, and deformity, which altogether constitutes a twisted sexual appeal (\nSeko and Kikuchi, 2020\n).\n\nFIGURE 2\n\n \n\nFigure 2\n. \nLast menhera\n (\nAmano and Ise, 2016\n) features a male protagonist who falls in love with a \nmenhera\n girl. Image reproduced with permission from the publisher Futaba-sha.\n\nThe Mad Woman\n\nWhereas, the sad girl narrative domesticates female madness as vulnerable and potentially erotic, the mad woman exaggerates her abnormality and derangement, particularly in the context of romantic relationships. In this narrative, the \nmenhera\n is obsessed with her love interest and makes devastating efforts to be with this person. Intriguingly, in many \nmanga, anime\n, and games, \nmenhera\n girls are first introduced as cute, loveable, and nurturing to their love interests. However, when a third person gets into the equation, their insecurity manifests as possessive thoughts and actions, overprotectiveness, and extreme jealousy that appears eccentric and terrifying to others (\nKato, 2018\n). Unlike the sad girls who walk a tightrope between the normal and the disordered, the mad woman firmly inhabits the realm of madness.\n\nIn the mad woman \nmenhera\n narrative, self-injury is often depicted as an act of interpersonal manipulation. For example, in her autobiographical self-help book titled “All Girls are \nMenhera\n,” self-identified “former” \nmenhera\n \nSuisui (2020)\n reflects her wrist cutting as motivated by an intense fear of abandonment. Whenever she needed reassurance, she self-cut in front of her boyfriend or sent him photos of her bleeding wounds. Although \nSuisui (2020)\n does not specify whether she had a diagnosable disorder, this self-mockery reflects the long-standing negative stereotype attached to people with BPD, the connotation first established in popular \n2-channel\n threads and expanded to mainstream popular culture—\nmenhera\n as troublesome attention seekers (\n090\n, \n2016b\n). The mad woman may also commit violence toward others, from verbal aggression to physical expressions, to perform her devotion to the beloved. Across recent \nmanga, anime\n, and games, \nmenhera\n girls are frequently portrayed as holding a sharp weapon indicating that their jealous aggression can be easily turned onto others (for an example of this caricature, see \nKurii, 2016\n)\n9\n.\n\nAnother salient and stereotypical caricature of the mad woman takes the form of her obsessive communication style. \nMenhera\n girls are often portrayed as engaging in digital stalking through relentless texting and social media monitoring to check their lovers' whereabouts and make sure they are always within reach. This “pathetic” behavior has become the subject of mockery and even gamification. For example, in 2016 rock band Mio Yamazaki released an Artificial Intelligence (AI) named \nMenhera\n Girlfriend as part of a promotional campaign for their new album (\nhttp://ai-girl-mio.jp/\n). This program allowed users to chat with a bot that sends sarcastic and depressive messages representative of \nmenhera\n personality. If a player does not respond quickly, the AI would text “Why don't you respond?” “Don't you love me?” or “Do you mean I should die?” imitating a \nmenhera\n girl going emotionally awry.\n\nSimilarly, a mobile gaming app named “\nMenhera\n Girlfriend and One Million Text Messages” features obsessive texting between a \nmenhera\n girl and her boyfriend (\nFigure 3\n). In this game, the player takes the role of a \nmenhera\n girl and sends an excessive amount of text messages to her boyfriend. The player earns points as they send a text and can exchange points for items and decorations. Items are saturated with satire and dark humor, including surveillance cameras that help monitor the boyfriend 24/7, or an assassin to eliminate any person who has a crush on the boyfriend. Launched in February 2014, the gaming app has reached 500,000 downloads in <1 year (\nHappy, Gamer Inc, 2015\n)\n10\n.\n\nFIGURE 3\n\n \n\nFigure 3\n. A screenshot of mobile game “\nmenhera\n girlfriend and one million messages.” The green speech bubbles represent excessive amounts of text messages from the \nmenhera\n girlfriend character. Image reproduced with permission from Happy Gamer Inc.\n\nIn these examples, the narrative trope is deployed in ways that disdain and embellish the girl, isolating “pathetic” behaviors within the individual. Whether she is struggling with mental ill-health no longer matters—the emotional blackmailing, obsessive texting and manipulative self-injury alone prove she \nis\n a \nmenhera\n. Further, the mad woman embodies a dualism between gender norms and deviation from them. On one hand, she opposes normative gender constructions by exhibiting aggression and violence historically associated with stereotypical masculinity. Her obsessive and assertive behavior appears frightening, immoral, and unfeminine. Yet on the other hand, her character trait still resonates with normative femininity in that her obsession with the beloved, albeit distasteful, can be seen embodying a feminine value of selfless devotion. In this regard, the mad woman \nmenhera\n trope represents what \nChouinard (2009)\n calls “postmodern monstrosity” associated with female madness. Analyzing film portrayals of mad womanhood, \nChouinard (2009)\n argues that mad women are depicted as horrific because they evoke deep-seated fears that “the monstrous other is always already inside the self” (p. 799). Similarly, the \nmenhera\n girl simultaneously embodies the menace long associated with mental ill-health and the all-too-human desire to love, care for, and nurture. With the innate moral and aesthetical ambiguity, she becomes a postmodern monster.\n\nThe Cutie\n\nThe final narrative trope is the cutie who embodies an emergent aesthetic of \nyami-kawaii\n (sick-cute), a subculture originating in Harajuku, a district in Tokyo known as the mecca of youth countercultures (\nRefinery29, 2018\n). As a portmanteau combining \nyami\n (sick, dark) with \nkawaii\n (cute), \nyami-kawaii\n mixes traditional cute elements with dark and grotesque motifs; pink hearts, strawberries, fluffy stuffed animals are juxtaposed with knives, blood splatters, hangman's nooses, syringes, pills, as well as suicidal slogans and swearwords (\nRefinery29, 2018\n). Practitioners of \nyami-kawaii\n fashion often feign injury by wearing bandages and eye patches or carrying syringes and needles as accessories. \nYami-kawaii\n makeup emphasizes a mental illness motif, including “sickly pale” foundation and red blush-lined eyes to make them “look like swollen from crying” to express the mental angst and “the need of comfort” (\nTerada and Watanabe, 2021\n). At the heart of this girl's subculture lies a proposition: \nmenhera\n is cute.\n\nIllustrator Ezaki Bisko is often credited to have popularized the \nyami-kawaii\n movement through his character \nMenhera-chan\n. Created in 2013 as a simple doodle posted on Twitter, the character has quickly gained popularity and expanded into a \nmanga\n series on Pixiv, an illustration-based online community (\nEzaki, 2018\n). The \nmanga\n features a group of schoolgirls who transform into justice heroines by slashing their wrists with a magical box cutter. The protagonist \nMenhera Pink\n and other “\nrisuka senshi\n (wrist cut warriors)” are big-eyed, lovely-faced girls in pastel-colored sailor suits with their wrists bandaged (indicating self-injury). They fight evil spirits that lure people into derangement, while concealing their real identities (i.e., ordinary schoolgirls) during the day (\nEzaki, 2018\n). It imitates the magical girl fantasy, a well-established \nmanga/anime\n genre that features metamorphosis that turns an ordinary girl into a super powered alter ego.\n\nAlthough it follows the convention of the magical girl genre, the cutie \nmenhera\n strategically disrupts traditionally innocuous \nkawaii\n culture through its encapsulation of mental angst and re-appropriation of self-injury. The portrayal of wrist cutting as a ritual for transformation is deliberate and provocative, oozing with dark humor. It is neither a red-flag symptom of mental morbidity nor a gesture of interpersonal manipulation, but a simple means of magical transformation to defeat evil spirits/mental illness. The \nmenhera\n girls are not mad or deranged, because mental illness has been detached and externalized as villains and it is their mission as justice warriors to defeat the evil. Rather than romanticizing or pathologizing self-injury, they calmly slash their arms to do their job.\n\nFrom its onset, the cutie \nmenhera\n narrative has been accompanied by a unique material culture. Ezaki Bisko has produced various character merchandise featuring \nMenhera Pin\nk and fellow wrist cut warriors since 2014. Many of the frilly, pastel-colored clothing and kitsch accessories carry provocative messages like “kill you,” “sick,” or “death” representing the duality of \nyami kawaii\n aesthetic (\nRefinery29, 2018\n). Among the \nMenhera\n-chan merchandise, the most controversial was the “\nrisuka\n bangle” (wrist-cut bracelet) that emulated gaping wounds caused by self-cutting. Produced by an indie brand Conpeitou in collaboration with Ezaki in October 2014, the bracelet was sold out quickly. The brand then made an announcement of a resale on Twitter in June 2015 (\nConpeitou, 2015a\n). However, this time it caused a storm of criticism on social media, resulting in immediate discontinuation of the product (\nConpeitou, 2015b\n). On the company's blog, the designer commented that they, too, had a long-term experience with self-injury and apologized to those who were offended by the idea of treating self-injury as a fashion item (\nConpeitou, 2015b\n).\n\nWhereas, the wrist-cut bracelet and other \nMenhera\n-chan merchandise have stirred criticism as trivializing self-injury and other “serious” issues behind the act, the idea of wearable/removable self-cuts paradoxically suggests the subversive potential of cute aesthetics. In the cutie \nmenhera\n trope, the \nyami-kawaii\n outfits and accessories can work as a sugar-coating layer to communicate one's inner turmoil and social discomfort in a playful and exaggerated manner. Drawing attention to its superficial materiality, the cutie \nmenhera\n plays resistance to a “symptomatic” reading, which assumes a text's truest meaning is not immediately apprehensible and must be unveiled by an expert interpreter (\nBest and Marcus, 2009\n). Against the medico-political proposition that there must be a “real” issue buried beneath one's self-injury, the wrist-cut bracelet reduces self-injury to the depthless surface, rendering it commodifiable, consumable, and thus controllable body work through the façade of cuteness.\n\nThis assertive, in-your-face cuteness of the cutie \nmenhera\n embodies what Sharon \nKinsella (1995)\n calls a “rebellious, individualistic, freedom-seeking attitude” (p. 229) of Japanese \nkawaii\n culture. However, whereas \nKinsella (1995)\n puts an emphasis on the infantile, escapist dimension of \nkawaii\n by equating being cute with behaving childlike, \nMenhera Pin\nk and wrist cut warriors engage in aggressive social commentary through their bloody fight against mental illness (evil spirits). Likewise, the practitioners of \nyami-kawaii\n fashion refute the premises of the medical model that casts self-injury as a self-evident sign of pathology. The scars and wounds could be read as a removable accessary, rather than unwanted marks of individual morbidity. Regarding the subversive potential of cute, \nBrzozowska-Brywczyńska (2007)\n contends that cute aesthetic embodies the Foucauldian heterotopia—“the place outside the norm, the site of revolutionary potential to change, to post an alternative order, where the coherence between words and reality is no more possible, where the paradox is structuring rule” (p. 225). As a heterotopic being, the cutie \nmenhera\n may perform the agentic self by pushing back against the pathologization long associated with female self-injury.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOver the past few decades, the slang \nmenhera\n has gained unique versatility to travel across the Japanese popular cultural landscape. Even though the term initially referred to a self-label for a person living with mental ill-health, a multitude of interpretations have emerged over time, transforming \nmenhera\n into a multivocal discourse. All three narrative tropes examined in this article are entangled with sociocultural constructions of mad womanhood in Japan. \nMenhera\n girls in some ways reproduce and reinforce traditional gender norms, while in other ways disrupt the framing of women with mental ill-health as abnormal others. Pejorative connotations associated with self-injury, such as attention-seeking, manipulative, and obsessive, mobilize the normative discourse that demonizes female aggression. Simultaneously, \nmenhera\n embody traditional femininity such as submissiveness, silence, and selfless devotion, which paradoxically enhances the desirability of \nmenhera\n girls as an object of affective consumption.\n\nEventually, \nmenhera\n has become part of what cultural critic \nAzuma (2009)\n metaphorically calls a postmodern “database” of cultural imaginaries. The database offers content creators an attractive caricature, a dramatic tool, and a source of plots with handy narrative tropes to draw from, while providing audiences with a rich repository of affective stimuli to satisfy their drives (\nAzuma, 2009\n). Within the database, \nmenhera\n becomes an archetype of contemporary female madness that can be consumed with little need of backstories and contextual knowledge. A series of personality traits attached to the slang \nmenhera\n (e.g., preoccupied attachment style, insecurity, excessive jealousy) are essentialized, caricatured, and sexualized, shaping the collective understanding of what \nmenhera\n girls \nare\n and \ndo\n. Self-injury is framed as an iconic act that confirms \nmenhera\n girls' abnormality, which in turn triggers a series of pre-packaged responses from contempt, pity, abhorrence, to attraction and fetish.\n\nOnce integrated into this ever-expanding database, the \nmenhera\n tropes play a powerful role in shaping one's experience with self-injury. Just as psychiatric diagnoses provide those facing life problems with “languages of suffering” to narrate their experiences (\nBrinkmann, 2014\n), the \nmenhera\n tropes may mobilize a set of understandings and potential actions distinct from clinical conceptualizations. In her study with female college students in Tokyo, \nMatsuzaki (2017)\n found that 13% of survey respondents had used the word \nmenhera\n in daily conversation to refer to themselves. Matsuzaki posits that mental health slangs like \nmenhera\n may provide people with a convenient frame of reference to understand and describe subjective experiences of mental ill-health. Here, the label \nmenhera\n may work metonymically to protect the persons who adapt it, since wearing it enables them to instantly perform a “mentally unhealthy” identity without disclosing actual medical diagnoses (if any) or the reason for their angst. For women who self-injure, it may be at times easier to call themselves \nmenhera\n to self-pathologize their abject self than to ponder root causes of their mental angst pertinent to the contemporary Japanese society – such as the patriarchal social system, the lack of equality caused by a widening socio-economic gap, and the pressures of economic deprivation (\nNae, 2018\n).\n\nThis process can be understood as what Ian Hacking has called “classifications of people” in that a system of classification formulates general truths about people's suffering (\nHacking, 2004\n). Drawing on Hacking's work, \nMillard (2013)\n argues that gendered pathology of self-cutting may exert powerful influence over women who self-injure. Millard notes: “as self-harm becomes further entrenched as ‘female cutting,' the more people gendered as female have access to a resonant behavioral pattern said to signify ‘distress”' (p. 136). Similarly, through the \nmenhera\n tropes, self-injury can be culturally recognized as a mean for women to externalize \nikizurasa\n (pain of living), which simultaneously frames self-injury as a self-sufficient act to classify a woman as \nmenhera\n. However, \nHacking (2004)\n further argues that the dialectic between classifications and people classified is rather dynamic and cyclical. When people interact with systems of classification, those who classified “cause systems of classification to be modified in turn” (p. 279), a feedback mechanism that he coined “looping effects.”\n\nIn the light of this looping effect, the intersection of mental health and female counterculture is worth further exploration. We have argued that the cutie \nmenhera\n embodies an inherent tension associated with the cute aesthetics between reproducing and subverting the existing social order. Although there is an understandable concern that their sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek attitude toward self-injury and mental illness may trivialize or fetishize the issue, the cutie \nmenhera\n's impulse to “cute-ify” the socially abject self—as a commodity amenable to change—can potentially disrupt pathological judgment ascribed to them. The cutificaction process may provide the opportunity for people who self-injure to open spaces for vocality and performance apart from the medical model that renders a clinical approach as the only appropriate way to make sense of self-injury. We thus echo \nKato (2018)\n proposition that \nyami-kawaii\n (sick-cute) culture may destabilize the long-standing undesirability of sick/detracted female bodies. The practitioners of \nmenhera\n fashion seem to thrive on dialectical oppositions: cute and ugly, engaged and apathetic, wild and tame, subordination and resistance to chauvinist fantasies. With the ambivalence at the heart of their aesthetics, the cutie \nmenhera\n cheekily questions: What's wrong with being mentally ill?\n\nNonetheless, the politically subversive potential of the \nmenhera\n subculture requires a cautious observation to avoid blind celebration or denigration. The cutie \nmenhera\n's social commentary is considerably limited to the realm of cisgender and heterosexist normativity. Their aesthetic focuses primarily on an idealized feminine cuteness and deviance from it, while little attention is paid to social class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, dis/ability, and other identity makers that may ascribe different meanings to self-injury and female madness. It would be fruitful for future research to apply an intersectional lens that takes into account material and discursive socio-political contexts that inform theorization of mad womanhood. Moreover, the \nmenhera\n-the-cutie subculture is deeply entangled with consumerism that equates empowerment with the capacity to purchase. As \nMooney (2018)\n comments on girls' digital subcultures, subversive identity performances by youth sometime end up swallowed by mainstream consumer culture. Given the widening socio-economic gap in Japan, future theoretical work should interrogate who has access to the subversive readings of self-injury and mental health, while others may fall into the prey of poverty and poverty shaming.\n\nConclusion\n\nToday, \nmenhera\n girls abound in Japanese popular culture in many forms and manifestations. One may encounter them in \nmanga, anime\n, games as well as clothing, makeup, and other character merchandise. Within the three narrative tropes examined in this article—the sad girl, the mad woman, and the cutie—self-injury functions as an iconic signifier of women's vulnerability, monstrosity, and desire for control over their bodies. Even though the act is strongly associated with one's mental ill-health, in these narrative tropes it also represents a deviant performance and a tongue-in-cheek statement of agency that troubles the pathological reading of the practice.\n\nGiven the ongoing dialectic between popular cultural classification and people classified, developing an intersectional, cross-disciplinary understanding of how popular culture represents self-injury has implications for clinical practice and research. Just like any other human behavior, clinical practices do not exist in a cultural vacuum. When people use cultural slangs like \nmenhera\n to explain their engagement with self-injury, they may attempt to narrate their pain of living that cannot be captured by a medical frame of reference. Their vernacular illness narrative can then feed back into the clinical system of classification and shape clinical providers' understanding of what self-injury \nis\n and \ndoes\n. In this regard, we concur with \nChandler (2014)\n assertion that attending to the diverse ways in which self-injury is understood and narrated “should comprise an important aspect of compassionate clinical practice” (p. 5). Exploring the cultural milieu wherein people explain, perform, and make sense of self-injury can illuminate important conversations occurring outside of the clinical practice that have considerable influence on people who self-injure and those who are affected by it.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nBoth authors have made a substantial and intellectual contribution to the work and approved the submitted manuscript.\n\nFunding\n\nThis work was supported by Ryerson University Faculty of Communication and Design under a new faculty start-up fund granted to YS.\n\nConflict of Interest\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\nPublisher's Note\n\nAll claims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated organizations, or those of the publisher, the editors and the reviewers.

Our use of this terminology is informed by our positionality that mirrors that of critical health communication and disability studies. It is also reflective of our experience working with people with lived experiences of self-injury.\n\n2. \n^\nSlice-of-life \nmanga\n (\nnichijō-kei in Japanese\n) \nrefers to a narrative genre that features realistic depictions of everyday, mundane life\n.\n\n3. \n^\nIn 2017, along with the transfer of ownership, all 2-channel past logs were opened to the public for free. According to the \n2-channel\n archives (\nhttps://mevius.5ch.net/utu/kako/kako0000.html\n), the mental health board was launched on November 21, 1999 by Nishimura Hiroyuki, the founder of 2-channel as “\nsou-utsu ban\n” (manic-depressive board). As of May 18, 2021, there were 75,987 threads posted under the mental health board with each thread hosting up to 1,000 posts.\n\n4. \n^\n2-channel\n changed its name to \n5-channel\n in 2017.\n\n5. \n^\nSince 1999, the mental health board has been hosted on 16 different servers. Most of the oldest threads were on a server named “piza” (\nhttps://piza.5ch.net/utu/kako/\n) that hosted a total of 6907 threads between November 1991 to July 2001. We went through the titles of 6907 threads and took a closer look at posts made to the 40 threads that include “\nrisuto kat\n (wrist cutting)” “\nrisuka\n (a portmanteau of \nrisu\nto\n \nka\nt\n)” or “\njisho\n (self-injury)” in their titles.\n\n6. \n^\nAround the same time, the term \nmenhera\n also generated art subculture among artists living with mental ill-health. Between 2014-16, a group of artists in Tokyo started applying this label to their work and organizing a yearly art fair called “\nMenhera\n Exhibit” to display and sell their “outsider art” (\nTAV Gallery, 2016\n).\n\n7. \n^\nThe term “sad girl” may remind some readers of the Sad Girls movement that had gone viral across North American social media around 2014-15. Digital artist Audrey Wollen (@tragicqueen), who is credited with coining the term “Sad Girl Theory” in 2014, claimed that the sadness of girls should be re-historicized as an act of resistance (\nTunnifliffe, 2015\n). Wollen's online performance of sadness, chronic illness, and depression can be considered a protest against the liberal feminist ideal of “Girl Power” that emphasizes women's will-power despite patriarchal social structures. By framing women/girls as responsible for their own success, the Girl Power discourse was criticized as denying and pathologizing women's sadness (\nMooney, 2018\n). Although there are certainly commonalities between the (White) Sad Girl movement and the sad girl \nmenhera\n, the latter is oriented more toward pathologization of female fragility and conformity to cultural norms rather than resistance to and disruption of such norms.\n\n8. \n^\nIn this article we present Japanese names in the Japanese convention – the family name (surname) followed by the given name (first name).\n\n9. \n^\nIn Japanese subculture, this caricature is sometimes called “\nyandere\n,” a portmanteau of “\nyanderu\n” (sick) and “\nderedere\n” (lovestruck), referring to a deranged girl who uses violence or brutality to express her obsessive love. \nKato (2018)\n argues that \nyandere\n embodies borderline personality disorder, while \nmenhera\n is “in the type of narcissistic personality disorder” (p. 47). Although we disagree with this blunt and pseudo-medical dualism, it is worth noting that \nyandere\n girl is an exaggerated caricature of \nmenhera\n girl with strong emphasis on her brutality.\n\n10. \n^\nIn June 2015, the company changed the game title to “\nYuru-yami\n girlfriend and one million messages” where the term \nyuru-yami\n (loosely sick) replaced \nmenhera\n. While Happy Gamer Inc. did not specify the reason for this decision, the game's official twitter alluded that Apple's app store policies might have led to the title change.

{"url": "https://rentablog.org/2023/09/19/japanese-for-nerds-oshikatsu-otakatsu-blkatsu-and-language/", "title": "Japanese for NERDS: Oshikatsu, Otakatsu, BLkatsu, and language – rentaBLog", "text": "Japanese for NERDS: Oshikatsu, Otakatsu, BLkatsu, and language – rentaBLog\n\nSkip to content\n\nAs you may have seen from my posts, I like to sprinkle in a lot of Japanese to help people learn and contextualize the language and culture a majority of our content comes from. While we’re a localization company, I know a lot of people who read manga do intend on eventually learning and hopefully mastering Japanese someday, whether it’s in order to not have to rely on English licenses to get that sweet, sweet content, or even just to be able to comfortably follow Japanese mangaka, publishers, or fan accounts, and it can be helpful to learn bit by bit through your hobbies.\n\nStill in the process of my own Japanese-learning journey (I think most language learning never actually ends, honestly—even in your native language), after living in Japan for four and a half years I’ve found there are a lot of words that’re hard to know without specifically taking part in the cultures surrounding them. The same way, say, Dungeons & Dragons or Genshin or even sports fanbases have their own own vocabulary and phrases that don’t make a lot of sense outside their core community, being a nerd in Japan has its own language that can be a bit difficult to grasp for those not in the know.\n\nA lot of these words take place within 推し活 (\noshikatsu\n, a word that’s hard to translate but is essentially “oshi life”)—the words people use to talk about their favorite characters, idols, artists, etc. The word \noshikatsu\n is a portmanteau (the Japanese language \nloves\n a good portmanteau) of 推し (\noshi,\n or fav, bias, etc.) and 活動 (\nkatsudou\n, activities), so essentially the activities and lifestyle of having an \noshi\n. People who already take part in online or in-person Japanese otaku events likely already know this world well—the world otaku allow themselves to fall into once they’ve finished the dull slog of everyday life. The real world might suck, but at least we have \noshikatsu\n to unwind to and enjoy with friends.\n\nIt’s actually such a common word at this point that it’s not rare to walk in to very average or trendy stores and see an \noshikatsu\n section filled with colorful \nnui\n clothes, things to make \nuchiwa\n, or even just pouches and accessories in colors that are common signifiers of your fav idol or character. (For instance, my favorite character from Genshin is Xiao, so I tend to buy a lot of thing in the teals, greens, and soft purples that make up his color palette.) Trendy bakeries, cake shops, etc.—living an otaku lifestyle is very common and normal, and it’s not rare at all seeing stores and brands catering to it.\n\nNonetheless, there are still a lot of words that are so highly specific to actually living \noshikatsu\n, \notakatsu\n (“otaku life”), or \nBLkatsu\n (“BL life”) so I’ll introduce some of those words here. (Using Genshin characters and ships for many of my examples, since those are the names I know best lol.)\n\n====================\n\n推し（おし） \noshi\nLet’s start with the easiest and most well-known phrases, but arguably the most important. \nOsu\n sounds similar to “push” but the kanji is different (押す) so the meaning also differs. This version is specific to the act of supporting, backing, or endorsing something. \nOshi\n is the noun version. It can be used like “Xiao is my \noshi\n!” but also “I am Xiao-\noshi\n!”\n\n単推し（たんおし）\ntan’oshi\nTan’oshi\n (not to be mistaken for 楽しい/\ntanoshii\n) isn’t super different from \noshi\n, but it’s a specific word used for when you like a group, but there is one member of the group you \nspecifically\n really really really love—your fav \nwithin\n a group that you like.\n\n箱推し（はこおし）\nhako’oshi\nHako’oshi\n is kind of the opposite of \ntan’oshi\n. \nHako\n means “box” so essentially you like a group as a full package and don’t particularly have a specific favorite member—you love everyone equally! \n\n====================\n\nオタク　\notaku\nEveryone knows this. Even non-otaku know this. But I wanted to include it to point out it’s actually a very common word, and doesn’t have the negative connotation that’s often pushed in the West. Anyone can be an otaku—it just means having an intense interest in something, from trains to idols to fashion to animals.\n\n腐女子（ふじょし）\nfujoshi\n“Ames, do you really think we don’t know what \nfujoshi\n means?” I’m sure everyone who reads this already knows this word, but it also felt wrong to leave it out of this section. For those who don’t know, \nfujoshi\n is an otaku who is specifically interested in BL content, whether in an “original content” sense or a “shipping” sense. \nFujoshi\n does NOT just mean a female otaku; some have tried to claim it as such but always get shot down by the larger community. (See also: 腐男子/\nfudanshi\n which is the male version, and \nfujin\n, the gender-neutral term which is exclusive to western spaces.)\n\n姫女子（ひめじょし）\nhimejoshi\nA \nhimejoshi\n is a female fan of GL/yuri! These are people who enjoy GL ships as well as original manga. There are some fans who exclusively prefer GL, but some might like BL and GL equally!\n\n夢女子（ゆめじょし）\nyumejoshi\nAs many know, \nyume\n means “dream.” A \nyumejoshi\n is a girl who prefers to self-insert with the male characters she likes. When she refers to her \noshi\n as her husband, she’s not being ironic or silly. There is sometimes \nsome\n polite crossover between \nfujoshi\n and \nyumejoshi\n but it’s generally not common, since they’re antithetical to each other.\n\nガチ恋（ガチこい）\ngachikoi\nGachikoi\n, or “legit love,” is used to refer to the act of falling in literal, sincere love with your \noshi\n. This is a bit more common in 2.5D and 3D fandoms, but is also possible with 2D. This term is often used disparagingly, since \ngachikoi\n are frequently seen as quite toxic and possessive of their \noshi\n, but it is possible to be a \ngachikoi\n without being weird about it.\n\n====================\n\nボーイズラブ・BL\nIf you don’t know what this is, I’m shocked you somehow made it to this blog. Boys’ Love is the genre name for depictions of male/male romantic and sexual relationships. I’m assuming you’re a fan of this if you’re reading this post. \n\nガールズラブ・GL\nGirls’ Love, perhaps more commonly referred to as yuri, is simply the female version of BL. There doesn’t seem to be much differentiation between yuri and GL the way there is for yaoi and BL, as most Japanese stores use the two names interchangably. \n\nティーンズラブ・TL\nTL is what we refer to on Renta! as “mature romance,” but the actual phrase is “teens love.” In all honesty, I’m not sure why it’s referred to as such, but the name had to be changed for a western market since this is all erotic content aimed at adult women, not teens. \n\nNL・HL\nNL and HL are the words used for het relationships and content. HL obviously stands for “hetero love.” Unfortunately NL stands for “normal love,” but I’ve been told there’s been a move away from this in recent years specifically because it’s rather offensive.\n\n====================\n\n一次創作（いちじそうさく）\nichijisousaku\nIchijisousaku\n can also just be referred to as \nsousaku\n, which is original content. This is not fanart or anything based off an existing series or franchise. The reason \nichi\n is sometimes placed at the front is in case an artist posts both original and derivative works to their account; by tagging it as \nichijisousaku\n it’s easy to differentiate that it’s their original work.\n\n二次創作（にじそうさく）\nnijisousaku\nNijisousaku\n, however, IS content based off an existing series, title, or franchise. This is all fanart, fanfiction, \ndoujinshi\n, and even cosplay content. Sometimes a mangaka will have a \nnijisousaku\n account specifically where they post fanart and such, but sometimes they leave it all in one place.\n\n創作BL（そうさくBL）\nsousaku BL\nAs you may have guessed by now, \nsousaku BL\n refers to original BL, so anything tagged with this uses original characters specific to the artist. This can be both self-published \nor\n commercial content.\n\n商業BL（しょうぎょうBL）\nshougyou BL\nShougyou BL\n, however, refers very specifically to licensed, published, commercial BL works. This means the title is commercially released in stores, and it’s not self-published by the author, or just a short story they wrote for social media. This is a useful tag for tracking down new titles and releases to look out for.\n\n====================\n\n沼（ぬま）\nnuma\nNuma\n means “swamp” or “bog.” Have you ever stepped into a swampy marsh and felt it pulling you down? And then it’s hard to pull your foot back out because of the pressure and suction from the mud? That’s \nnuma\n—a semi-joking phrase that means you’ve been dragged down into the filth of a series or character or pairing and now there’s no getting out. This is particularly common when someone is feeling themselves dragged into a new fandom, or trying to convince a friend to get in the “swamp” with them.\n\n====================\n\nジャンル　\ngenre\nDO NOT be fooled by this phrase—it sits firmly in the camp of \nwasei eigo\n, Japanese phrases taken from English that mean something only vaguely related. “Genre” in the \noshikatsu\n sense refers to the series or fandom, \nnot\n the content within (romance, action, scifi, and so on).\n\nI made this mistake once with a Japanese friend who planned on tabling at a \ndoujinshi\n event. She told me she was planning to release a Touken Ranbu book, and I asked “which genre?” and she gave me a weird look and repeated “Touken Ranbu.” Needless to say, I’ll never forget the difference now.\n\n====================\n\n次元（じげん）シリーズ　\n“jigen” series\nJigen\n means “dimension” so these are used to differentiate between fiction and reality…\n2次元（にじげん）\nni jigen\nNijigen\n is the 2D world, where fictional oshi roam. Anime, game, and manga otaku are the lords of the \nnijigen\n, and many of these type of otaku say they’re really only interested in 2D.\n\n3次元（さんじげん）\nsan jigen\nSanjigen\n is often used as slang to refer to the “real world,” the one where humans roam. 2D otaku may often speak disparagingly of “3D” and the things within (similar to phrases like “I’m not interested in 3D men—only 2D!”), but there are also many otaku who like 3D things like idols, musicians, movie stars, etc. A BL mangaka oshi would also be included in here (though it feels weird to phrase it that way).\n\n2.5次元（にてんごじげん）\nni-ten-go jigen\nNi-ten-go\n is the weird space between filled by actors \nplaying\n your fictional oshi, common to stage plays or occasionally drama or movie roles. However, 2.5 can also be used to refer to \nseiyuu\n or VTubers—people who you may like only because they voice your fictional fav, or you know there’s a real human in there somewhere, but you like them based on their fictional, 2D persona. \n\n生もの（ナマモノ）\nnamamono/\nnmmn\nAs was previously discussed in the post all about \nnamamono\n rules and culture, this is the shipping of actual living, breathing, 3D (or 2.5D) humans. \nNama\n means “raw” and \nmono\n means “thing” or “object,” so \nnamamono\n content is content dealing with living organisms. If you want to read more about \nnamamono\n, check out: \n“There’s Fanfiction About Us?”\n\n====================\n\nカップリング　\ncoupling\n“Coupling” (“CP”) or \nkappu\n is just the word for “ship.” \n\n推しカップ（おしカップ）\noshikappu\n / 自カップ（じカップ）\njikappu\nOshikappu\n or \njikappu\n refers to “OTP”—this couple is your ride or die, the one you put all of your time and effort head-canoning and creating content for. \n\n====================\n\n右・左（みぎ・ひだり）\nmigi/hidari\nAs many people who’ve taken beginner Japanese know, \nmigi\n and \nhidari\n simply mean “right” and “left,” so perhaps some of you are surprised to see them on here. But, as I discussed in my post all about \nnamamono\n, \nmigi\n and \nhidari\n refer to which side of the pairing name a character appears on.\n\nIn western fandom, the order of the pairing name seems to matter less than the vibe of how the name sounds i.e. I’ve seen “xiaoven” (the Genshin ship for Xiao and Venti) refer to Xiao topping, Venti topping, or reversible. In Japanese fandom, however, the ordering of the pairing name is serious business, and the character who tops is on the left, and the character who bottoms is on the right i.e. “Do you like ‘xiaoven’ or ‘venxiao’?” Thus, you might see something like 魈右, or “Xiao \nmigi\n,” meaning the person is only interested in Xiao bottom.\n\n固定（こてい）\nkotei\nKotei\n, meaning “fixed” or “anchored,” refers to someone who only likes content a specific way. For instance, if I said I was トマト固定 (\nthomato kotei)\n, referring to the Genshin ship Thoma/Ayato, it would mean not only do I not want to read content of them with other people, but I also don’t want to read the reverse shipping order. I am only 100% specifically interested in Thoma topping Ayato, and Ayato bottoming for Thoma.\n\n総攻め・総受け（そうぜめ・そううけ）\nsouzeme/sou’uke\nSouzeme\n and \nsou’uke\n is the very BL culture version of saying something like \nmigi kotei\n or \nhidari kotei\n—it means in your heart, a character is either 100% seme or 100% uke. It doesn’t matter what character they’re with, but they should only ever top OR only ever bottom. To use Xiao again, for instance, I could say Xiao is \nsou’uke\n to me, meaning he \nnever\n tops, no matter who he’s with.\n\nリバ・逆（リバ・ぎゃく）\nriba/gyaku\nRiba\n and \ngyaku\n refer to couples that are either 100% reversible, or switch occasionally. \nRiba\n is much more common in a genre sense, and is used more commonly in official and original BL. \n\n雑食（ざっしょく）\nzasshoku\nIf Japanese fandom sounds a bit too strict and intense to you, just know that there are also \nzasshoku\n—“omnivores,” which is the word for multishippers and people who aren’t super particular about the ship, who tops or bottoms, etc. as long as the content is delicious.\n\n====================\n\n地雷（じらい）\njirai\nJirai\n means “landmine,” and it’s the word people use to refer to content that they \nvery\n heavily dislike. It’s similar to “squick” in the West, but quite a lot stronger, and often used in the context that if you post a specific type of content, the person will block you, or if a certain type of content is YOUR \njirai\n then you should block them.\n\nA \njirai\n can be as big as “character death” and as seemingly inconsequential as specific ships or characters. It’s content you absolutely don’t want to see for any reason because it irritates you and ruins your day.\n\nSome very common \njirai\n:\n×\n女体化\n（にょたいか）\nnyotaika\n – depicting one or both characters as female\n×\nリョナ \nryona\n – sometimes referred to as “whump” in the west\n×\n固定（こてい）\nkotei\n – anything that goes against their “fixed” preferences\n\n自衛（じえい）\njiei\nJiei\n simply means self-defense, but it’s a strong belief in online communities that a person is in charge of their \nown\n comfort and happiness online. For this reason, blocking, muting, and putting very clear warnings about what one can expect from following your social media is encouraged. It may seem like gatekeeping from the outside, but it’s to avoid fandom in-fighting and policing.\n\n担当（たんとう）\ntantou\nThe \ntantou\n is usually the head or manager of something, so \ntantou\n is used similar to \noshi\n to indicate your fav, but is often more specific to idol series (particularly older ones like Idol Master, Uta no Prince-sama, and Idolish7). It’s similar to saying “I am the manager of xyz idol.” However, unlike with \noshi\n, the phrasing for \ntantou\n is more restrictive—if I said “Xiao is my \ntantou\n” that would be like saying Xiao is my manager. It can only be the other way around. \n\n同担（どうたん）\ndoutan\nDou\n means “same” and \ntan\n is the same from \ntantou\n, so this essentially means you’re managing the same idol. However, this is also just generally used to refer to people who have the same \noshi\n as you. There are two very important versions of this phrase, though:\n　\n同担歓迎（どうたんかんげい）\ndoutan kangei\n　willing/seeking for friends with the same \noshi\n.\n　\n同担拒否（どうたんきょひ）\ndoutan kyohi\n　doesn’t want to associate with people with the same \noshi\n.\n\n垢（あか）\naka\nAka\n literally just means dirt or grime, but it’s a play on words for the shortened version of アカウント (account). \nAka\n refers to someone’s social media account. For instance, one might have an account specifically for talking about Genshin, so 原神専用垢 (\nGenshin senyou aka\n, or “Genshin-specific account”). It’s particularly common, especially previously, to refer to people’s shit-posting or personal accounts with this kanji.\n\n雑多（ざった）\nzatta\nZatta\n just means “misc.” and is thus generally refers to a multi-fandom account. It’s often used in the insinuation “don’t follow me if you’re only interested in _______” since if you follow this type of account after seeing a bunch of cute Xiao fanart, you’ll end up annoyed when they move on to drawing another fandom next week.\n\n====================\n\nAnyway, that’s all for today! I hope you find these interesting, or useful! Sometimes maneuvering JP fandom can be a bit stressful, since the fandom culture is quite different. Culture shock isn’t only for specifically visiting a country anymore, now that the internet has made everything so easy to access.\n\nAre there any words I didn’t include here that you’ve learned specifically from your fandom? Feel free to post them in the comments, since I’m sure someone will find them useful! I know there are a lot of words I left out, since I didn’t have the time or space, and this was meant to be more informative rather than as a glossary. \n\nShare this:\n\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\n\nX\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\nFacebook\n\nLike\n \nLoading...\n\nRelated\n\n \n\n \n\n Published by \names\n \n\n I love BL manga and cats and cool weather. \n\n View all posts by ames \n\n 5 thoughts on “\nJapanese for NERDS: Oshikatsu, Otakatsu, BLkatsu, and language\n” \n\nLoved this!

Whether someone has encountered this style through social media or anime culture, they're typically looking for guidance on how to create their jirai kei look without appropriating its deeper cultural meanings.\n\nThis style represents more than clothing choices—it's a form of emotional expression that resonates with those who find beauty in vulnerability and strength in embracing their complex feelings.\n\nWhat is Jirai Kei Fashion?\n\nJirai kei fashion emerged from Japanese internet culture in the early 2020s, originating from the derogatory term \"jirai onna\", which translates to \"landmine type\" or \"landmine girl.\" This Japanese fashion movement transforms what was initially a derogatory term into a powerful form of self-expression, combining elements of gothic lolita fashion with kawaii culture to create a distinctive aesthetic that celebrates emotional authenticity.\n\nThe Jirai Kei style centers around a carefully curated contrast between innocent, doll-like elements and darker, Gothic influences. Practitioners typically incorporate pale, porcelain-like makeup, twin-tailed hairstyles, and clothing that blends black and pink color schemes with lace, ribbons, and platform shoes. This aesthetic choice represents more than fashion—it's a visual language for expressing complex emotional states and challenging traditional notions of beauty.\n\nKey Elements of Jirai Kei Style\n\nColor Palette and Visual Harmony\n\nThe jirai kei style color scheme revolves around a sophisticated three-color system: black, white, and various shades of pink. These colors work together to create visual tension that mirrors the emotional complexity the style represents. Black provides the gothic foundation, while white adds ethereal lightness, and pink introduces the kawaii element that softens the overall dark appearance.\n\nSilhouette and Proportion\n\nJirai kei silhouettes emphasize femininity through carefully constructed proportions. High-waisted skirts create an hourglass shape while maintaining modesty, often paired with fitted tops that balance the voluminous bottom half. Platform shoes add height and drama, contributing to the doll-like aesthetic that is central to the style.\n\nLayering plays a crucial role in achieving authentic jirai proportions. Practitioners often wear multiple items simultaneously—lace socks under platform shoes, cardigans over fitted tops, or accessories that create visual interest without overwhelming the core silhouette.\n\nTexture and Material Selection\n\nFabric choices in kei fashion emphasize contrast and sensory appeal. Delicate materials like lace, chiffon, and silk create softness that balances harder elements such as leather, vinyl, or metal accessories. This textural contrast reinforces the style's core theme of juxtaposing innocence with edge.\n\nPopular Accessories in Jirai Kei\n\nHair Accessories and Styling\n\nHair accessories serve as primary focal points in jirai styling, with twin tails being the signature hairstyle. These pigtails typically feature curled ends and decorative elements such as ribbons, bows, or character-themed clips. The positioning and styling of twin tails requires practice to achieve the proper doll-like proportions that define the aesthetic.\n\nBeyond basic twin tails, advanced practitioners incorporate specialized accessories, such as hair rings, decorative bobby pins, or themed clips featuring characters from anime or gaming culture.\n\nBag Selection and Symbolic Items\n\nSmall backpacks, particularly those with character themes or in the signature color palette, serve both practical and aesthetic functions. These bags often feature additional decorative elements, such as keychains, pins, or attached plushies.\n\nBeyond mainstream options, Jirai practitioners often customize their bags with pins, patches, or attachments that reflect personal interests while maintaining aesthetic coherence.\n\nPlatform Shoes and Footwear\n\nPlatform shoes represent perhaps the most immediately recognizable element of jirai kei fashion. These shoes typically feature significant height increases—often 2-4 inches—while incorporating design elements like buckles, straps, or decorative hardware. The platforms serve multiple functions: they alter body proportions to create a more doll-like appearance, add drama to the overall look, and provide opportunities for expressing personal style through design choices.\n\nHow to Create Your Own Jirai Kei Look\n\nBuilding a Foundation Wardrobe\n\nCreating an authentic Jirai wardrobe begins with establishing foundational pieces that can be mixed and matched effectively. Start with a high-waisted pleated skirt in black or dark gray, as this item serves as the cornerstone for most jirai outfits. Pair this with fitted tops in white or pale pink that can accommodate layering with cardigans or light jackets.\n\nThe plus-size community has enthusiastically embraced jirai kei fashion, with many pieces available in extended sizing that maintain the essential proportions and aesthetic elements. When building a foundation wardrobe, prioritize fit over exact brand matching, as proper proportions matter more than specific labels for achieving authentic presentation.\n\nEssential Jirai Kei Pieces and Styling\n\nFor those seeking authentic Jirai pieces, \nMOEFLAVOR offers anime-inspired designs\n in inclusive sizing from XS to 4XL. Their \ngyaru jirai kei collection\n features carefully curated pieces that capture the aesthetic's essential elements while maintaining high-quality construction and attention to detail.\n\nThe \nJapanese Jirai Kei Babydoll Lingerie Set\n exemplifies the style's balance between innocence and edge, featuring delicate lace details paired with the signature black and pink color scheme. This piece demonstrates how Jirai fashion transforms intimate wear into artistic expression while maintaining comfort and quality craftsmanship.\n\nFor swimwear options that embody Jirai aesthetics, the \nJirai Kei Grey Pink Bikini\n showcases how the style adapts to different garment categories while preserving its core visual elements. The thoughtful color combination and design details reflect the movement's emphasis on authentic expression through carefully considered aesthetic choices.\n\nJirai Kei Makeup Application Techniques\n\nJirai kei makeup focuses on creating a doll-like appearance that emphasizes large eyes, pale complexion, and subtle color accents. This makeup style begins with a pale foundation that creates a porcelain-like skin tone, often lighter than the natural skin tone, to achieve the ethereal quality central to the aesthetic. This pale base serves as the canvas for more dramatic eye makeup and lip makeup treatments.\n\nLayering and Coordination\n\nSuccessful jirai styling requires mastering layering techniques that create visual interest without appearing cluttered. Start with basic combinations—such as a fitted top under an open cardigan—then gradually incorporate additional elements like lace socks, decorative belts, or layered necklaces. Each additional layer should contribute to the overall aesthetic rather than competing for attention.\n\nThe \nJapanese Jirai Kei Garter Lingerie Set\n demonstrates advanced layering principles, combining multiple elements that work together to create a cohesive visual impact. This type of detailed construction shows how MOEFLAVOR's exclusive designs offer custom-fit options with separate top and bottom sizing, accommodating diverse body types while maintaining aesthetic integrity.\n\nThe Meaning Behind Jirai Kei Style\n\nCultural Context and Emotional Expression\n\nJirai kei fashion represents more than aesthetic choices—it functions as a form of emotional communication that allows practitioners to externalize complex feelings about identity, vulnerability, and strength. The style emerged from Japanese youth culture during a period of social isolation and uncertainty, providing a visual language for experiences that traditional fashion categories couldn't address.\n\nCommunity and Support Networks\n\nOnline communities centered around Jirai fashion often function as informal support networks where participants share not only styling advice but also emotional experiences and mutual encouragement. These communities demonstrate how fashion subcultures can provide meaningful connections and understanding for individuals who might otherwise feel isolated or misunderstood.\n\nIdentity and Self-Empowerment\n\nFor many practitioners, Jirai fashion provides a framework for exploring and expressing identity in ways that mainstream fashion cannot accommodate. The style's embrace of contradictions—cute yet dark, innocent yet knowing—mirrors the complexity of contemporary youth experience and offers alternatives to simplified identity categories.\n\nHow Modern Trends Shape Jirai Kei\n\nDigital Culture and Social Media Influence\n\nSocial media platforms have fundamentally shaped Jirai fashion development, with various styles evolving rapidly through shared content, tutorials, and community feedback. Unlike traditional fashion movements that developed through print media or physical scenes, Jirai represents one of the first major fashion subcultures to originate and develop primarily through digital platforms.\n\nTikTok tutorials and Instagram posts provide accessible education about styling techniques, makeup application, and outfit coordination. This digital accessibility has democratized participation in Jirai culture while enabling rapid style evolution and international adoption. The visual nature of these platforms particularly suits Jirai's emphasis on carefully constructed aesthetic presentation.\n\nGlobal Adaptation and Local Interpretation\n\nAs Jirai spreads internationally, practitioners adapt core elements to local contexts while maintaining essential aesthetic principles. These adaptations demonstrate the style's flexibility and cultural resilience, as practitioners find ways to honor origins while making the aesthetic relevant to their cultural contexts and practical needs.\n\nInternational practitioners often incorporate locally available brands and materials while maintaining color palettes, silhouettes, and styling principles that connect their presentations to the broader jirai community.\n\nCommercial Development and Accessibility\n\nThe growing popularity of Jirai fashion has attracted commercial attention, with various retailers developing lines specifically targeting this market. MOEFLAVOR stands out by offering original anime-inspired designs that aren't mass-produced copies, ensuring each piece maintains the authenticity and exclusivity that Jirai enthusiasts value. Their commitment to inclusive sizing and custom-fit options reflects an understanding of the community's diverse needs and body-positive values.\n\nSocial Media's Role in Spreading Jirai Kei Style\n\nPlatform-Specific Development\n\nDifferent social media platforms have contributed uniquely to the Jirai fashion development and dissemination. Instagram's visual focus supports the carefully curated aesthetic presentation central to Jirai culture, while TikTok's short-form video format proves ideal for makeup tutorials and styling demonstrations. YouTube offers a platform for longer-form educational content and community discussions.\n\nThese platform differences create complementary functions within the broader Jirai digital ecosystem. Practitioners often maintain a presence across multiple platforms, utilizing each for its strengths—Instagram for outfit inspiration, TikTok for techniques, and YouTube for detailed tutorials or community discussions.\n\nInfluencer Culture and Authentic Representation\n\nKey influencers within Jirai culture often emphasize education and community building over pure aesthetic presentation. The most respected figures in Jirai social media combine styling expertise with cultural literacy, helping newcomers understand not just how to achieve the look but also its significance and proper context.\n\nThis educational approach distinguishes Jirai influencer culture from more commercialized fashion promotion. Authentic jirai content creators typically prioritize community welfare and cultural respect over individual promotion, creating content that serves the broader community rather than simply building personal brands.\n\nGlobal Community Formation\n\nSocial media enables international Jirai communities to form and maintain connections across geographic boundaries. These global communities share resources, provide mutual support, and collaborate on cultural development, all while respecting the Japanese origins of the style. This international participation enriches Jirai culture while demonstrating fashion's potential for meaningful cross-cultural communication.\n\nJirai Kei's Presence in Japanese Pop Culture\n\nAnime and Gaming Influences\n\nJirai fashion draws significant inspiration from anime and gaming culture, particularly character designs that combine kawaii aesthetics with darker themes. This influence appears in specific styling choices, color combinations, and the overall approach to creating idealized yet emotionally complex presentations.\n\nThe relationship between Jirai and anime culture runs deeper than surface aesthetic borrowing. Both cultural forms explore themes of emotional complexity, identity performance, and the tension between innocence and experience that defines much contemporary Japanese youth culture. This thematic alignment explains why Jirai resonates so strongly within communities already engaged with anime and gaming culture.\n\nAccessories like the \nJirai Kei Kawaii Nails\n demonstrate how the aesthetic extends beyond clothing into detailed personal styling. These carefully designed elements reflect MOEFLAVOR's attention to authentic cultural details while providing accessible ways for practitioners to incorporate jirai elements into their overall presentation.\n\nStreet Fashion Evolution\n\nJirai represents the latest evolution in Japan's rich street fashion tradition, building on previous movements such as gothic lolita, decora, and visual kei, while addressing contemporary cultural concerns. This positioning within Japan's street fashion history provides cultural legitimacy while demonstrating the ongoing vitality of Japanese fashion innovation.\n\nMedia Representation and Cultural Impact\n\nJapanese media coverage of Jirai fashion reflects broader cultural negotiations around youth expression, mental health awareness, and changing gender roles. This coverage often emphasizes the style's role in providing creative outlets for emotional expression while raising questions about the relationship between fashion choices and psychological well-being.\n\nIf you're drawn to subversive and expressive fashion, you might also enjoy our guide on \nsexy Halloween costume ideas\n, where bold styling meets character-inspired confidence. For a deeper dive into artistic self-expression through restraint and aesthetics, explore our breakdown of \nwhat is Shibari\n —a visual and emotional art form with strong ties to Japanese culture.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is the main appeal of Jirai Kei fashion?\n\nThe primary appeal lies in Jirai's unique ability to express emotional complexity through visual aesthetics. Unlike mainstream fashion that often emphasizes simplicity or obvious beauty standards, Jirai celebrates contradiction and depth. Practitioners find liberation in a style that acknowledges both the light and dark aspects of the human experience, while creating striking visual presentations that command attention and respect.\n\nCan anyone adopt the Jirai Kei style regardless of age or background?\n\nWhile Jirai originated within Japanese youth culture, its core principles of authentic self-expression and emotional honesty can resonate across age groups and cultural backgrounds. Older practitioners may adapt elements such as color palettes or makeup techniques while adjusting silhouettes and styling choices to suit their lifestyle needs. The key lies in understanding the cultural significance while finding personal ways to honor its meaning.\n\nHow can someone start incorporating Jirai Kei elements into their existing wardrobe?\n\nBegin with small additions that introduce key elements without requiring complete wardrobe replacement. A black pleated skirt paired with existing tops, platform shoes worn with current outfits, or jirai-inspired makeup techniques can provide an introduction to the aesthetic. Gradually incorporate accessories like hair ribbons, layered necklaces, or bags in the signature color palette as comfort and interest develop.\n\nWhat does \"kei\" mean in Japanese fashion terminology?\n\nIn Japanese fashion contexts, \"kei\" roughly translates to \"style\" or \"type,\" indicating a specific aesthetic category or subculture. Kei fashion terms like \"jirai kei,\" \"gyaru kei,\" or \"lolita kei\" use this suffix to denote distinct styling approaches with their own rules, communities, and cultural significance. Understanding this terminology helps navigate Japanese fashion subcultures with appropriate cultural awareness.\n\nDo practitioners need to be Japanese or live in Japan to participate in jirai kei authentically?\n\nAuthentic participation depends more on cultural respect, community engagement, and genuine appreciation than geographic location or ethnic background. International practitioners can participate meaningfully by learning about origins, supporting authentic voices within the community, and approaching the style with appropriate cultural sensitivity. The global Jirai community includes practitioners from diverse backgrounds who contribute positively to cultural development.\n\nWhat's the difference between Jirai Kei and other Japanese fashion subcultures?\n\nJirai distinguishes itself through its unique blend of kawaii and gothic elements, an emphasis on emotional authenticity, and community-driven development via digital platforms. While sharing some aesthetic elements with Gothic Lolita and Decora styles, Jirai addresses contemporary concerns about mental health awareness, digital identity, and authentic self-expression, reflecting the current cultural context rather than historical fashion movements.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nJirai kei fashion represents far more than a trend—it's a cultural movement that transforms personal vulnerability into artistic expression while building supportive communities around shared aesthetic values. The style's careful balance of kawaii cuteness with gothic darkness creates a unique visual language that resonates with individuals seeking authentic ways to express emotional complexity.\n\nFor those interested in exploring Jirai fashion, success depends on understanding both its aesthetic elements and cultural significance. This means learning proper styling techniques while respecting the community values and cultural origins that give the movement meaning. The emphasis on authenticity over perfection creates space for personal interpretation within established frameworks.\n\nThe style's integration of plus-size inclusivity and accessibility through online communities demonstrates fashion's potential for genuine inclusivity when driven by community values rather than commercial considerations. This accessibility ensures that Jirai can continue serving a diverse range of participants while maintaining its cultural integrity and authentic community connections.\n\nCitations:\n[1] \nhttps://dokodemo.world/en/feature/344/\n[2] \nhttps://www.lolitainside.com/blogs/lolita/the-fascinating-blend-of-cute-and-dark-in-japanese-fashion-jirai-kei\n[3] \nhttps://www.yokogaomag.com/editorial/jirai-kei\n[4] \nhttps://www.tokyoweekender.com/art_and_culture/fashion/jirai-kei-fashion/\n\nShare\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare\n\nTweet on X\n\nPin it\n\nPin on Pinterest\n\nicon-left-arrow\n Back to Blog\n\nicon-X\n\n\"Close (esc)\"\n\nicon-X\n\nicon-chevron\n\nicon-X\n\nJirai Kei Fashion: Full Guide to Japan's Dark Feminine Style", "language": "lang_en", "country": "jp"}
